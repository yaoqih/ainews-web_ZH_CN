# AI Twitter Recap


**DeepSeek launched V4.1-Flash as a new open-weight flagship focused on extreme inference efficiency and low cost.**

- Independent benchmark account Artificial Analysis reported that DeepSeek V4.1 Flash surpasses DeepSeek V4 Pro 0813 despite being much cheaper, scoring **40 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index**, just below GLM-5.3-Flash and above the latest V4 Pro, while being priced at **$0.30 / 1M input tokens** and **$1.20 / 1M output tokens** with **cached input at $0.006 / 1M** and an additional **50% off-peak discount**; they also describe it as a **763B total-parameter** model with **8B active input** and **16B active output** parameters, **1M-token context**, text+image input, **MIT license**, and US/API availability via DeepSeek first party [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422), [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148681962913915), [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148684185972758)
- Vals called it the new **#1 open-weight model on the Vals Index**, ahead of Kimi K3, at just **$0.30 per test**, the cheapest model in the open-weight top 10; they also note the eval ran with **1M context**, **384 max output tokens**, **temperature 1**, default top-p/top-k, and **high reasoning effort** [@ValsAI](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2098125164072554545), [@ValsAI](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2098125177116848591), [@ValsAI](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2098125179092431297)
- Baseten shipped day-0 support and summarized the product positioning as **smarter, faster, and more efficient than DeepSeek v4 Pro 0813**, with **text and vision**, **US-only**, **ZDR**, and **1M context** [@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2098169972874994071)
- Ollama began rolling it out to **Max and Team** accounts, later expanding to **Pro plan subscribers** [@ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/2098188014119985406), [@ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/2098188470305128692), [@ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/2098235674793242770)



## Architecture and paper-level technical details


**The most discussed technical novelty is a causal encoder-decoder design aimed at lowering active compute and KV/cache costs.**

- Artificial Analysis says the model uses a **new causal Encoder–Decoder architecture**, with **8B active parameters for input/prefill** and **16B active parameters for output/decode** [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- Sebastian Raschka characterized V4.1 as a **“big overhaul”** and said they “should have called it DeepSeek V5,” explicitly highlighting the **encoder-decoder setup** as the key break from prior DeepSeek generations [@rasbt](https://x.com/rasbt/status/2098142625819672603)
- Multiple technical readers reacted to the design as unusually hybrid: one called it “a very interesting mix of very conservative and sometimes old ideas in research and potentially cutting edge efficiency and hardware design in engineering” [@_xjdr](https://x.com/_xjdr/status/2098106496282448013)
- A concise architecture read from Stochastic Chasm compared the design philosophy to **HySparse, NSA, and DeepSeek’s own CSA/HCA from V4**, summarizing it as a **local sliding-window branch plus sparse retrieval branch**, suggesting this sparse/local hybrid is becoming a broader pattern [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098102323268767832)
- The same account noted multimodal changes were **not radical**, saying DeepSeek mostly “lets the backbone handle most of it and give it visual tokens,” with **3x3 pixel unshuffle** instead of the more common **2x2** [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098116030627455450)
- They later flagged a “big difference from K3 on vision encoders,” implying the vision front-end diverges materially from recent Chinese peers [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098165237400953054)
- TeortaxesTex observed a recurring DeepSeek pattern of doing something unusual in the **first N layers**—previously dense or hash-routed, now **SWA-only**—speculating this may reflect repeated training difficulties in early layers [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098132297253896451)
- Later, the same account argued the stack is “down to **40 layers**, arguably only **20 legit decoder layers**,” underscoring just how aggressively DeepSeek may be compressing effective depth in decode-critical paths [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098176524612510102)
- Another thread fragment from TeortaxesTex suggested DeepSeek is doing **multiple compression frequencies**, “it’s just all CSA2,” in response to architectural discussion around memory compression [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098131613678707129)
- Nrehiew’s technical notes emphasize **KV cache compression** as central to the design, calling it a case study in “how obsessing over KV Cache compression gets you a hyper-efficient frontier model” [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2098170409686647263)
- In a follow-up, nrehiew highlighted infrastructure specifics from the report: **dispatch strategy to reduce long-tail stalls**, **router replay from previous checkpoints**, management of shorter-completion off-policy effects via **dataset-level capping**, **discard schemes**, **bounded off-policy ratio and loss masking**, and **persistent KVs and routers** when a new checkpoint is updated; they also mention a final stage with **full-vocab OPD on 40+ teacher models** [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2098170443660402942)
- Nrehiew concluded that the design looks cleaner than the older **HSA + CSA** combination in V4, saying it was “very clearly designed for inference,” and cited a striking **~890 bytes/token KV size** for the benchmarked score regime [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2098170450526543892)
- Stochastic Chasm inferred **QAT for the KV cache**, saying this would explain why the model performs better than peers under **FP4 KV cache** [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098154481750020375)



## Benchmark results and numbers


**Independent evals consistently paint V4.1-Flash as unusually strong on cost-adjusted intelligence, long context, and automation, with a major caveat around verbosity.**

- Artificial Analysis’ headline: **40 AA Index**, above V4 Pro and below GLM-5.3-Flash [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422), corroborated separately by Scaling01 [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2098136324603547907)
- Artificial Analysis reported **AutomationBench-AA: 69%**, tying **GPT-6 Astra (69%)** and above **Grok 4.6 (67%)**, while improving **15 points** over V4 Flash 0731 and sitting **12 points above V4 Pro 0813 (57%)** and **7 points above GLM-5.3 (62%)** [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- On GDPval-AA v2 it reportedly gains **164 Elo**, from **1468 to 1632**, overtaking **Kimi K3 at 1584** [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- On **AA-LCR v1.1** it scores **84%**, on par with **GPT-5.6 Sol** and **Gemini 3.8 Flash** at **84%** [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- Artificial Analysis also says V4.1 Flash is among the **most verbose models measured**, averaging **89k tokens per Intelligence Index task**—**25% more** than GLM-5.3 (71k), **29% more** than GLM-5.3-Flash (69k), **62% more** than V4 Pro 0813 (55k), and even above **Fable 5.1 (78k)** and **Claude Opus 5 (73k)** [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- Even with that verbosity, AA estimates just **$0.27 per Intelligence Index task**, roughly **7x below GLM-5.3 ($2.01)** and **Kimi K3 ($2.00)**, and **~2.5x below V4 Pro 0813 ($0.67)** [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- Vals’ result reinforces cost leadership: **$0.30/test**, #1 open-weight on their board [@ValsAI](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2098125164072554545)
- A separate reaction thread summarized DeepSWE-style claims more aggressively, saying V4.1 Flash offered **better performance than GPT-5.6 Sol and Opus 5 in DeepSWE at 94% lower API costs**, but that statement is secondhand summary rather than a primary benchmark post in this dataset [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2098107083665060275)

## Running it locally and inference engineering reactions


**A large fraction of discussion centered on the surprising ease of running V4.1-Flash on commodity-ish local hardware through offload and SSD streaming.**

- Fraser Price reported **full-precision DeepSeek 4.1 Flash + DSpark at 200 TPS on 4 Max-Qs with just 64GB system RAM**, offloading a **200GB Engram/hash table to NVMe**; he says this made keeping the full structure in RAM unnecessary and promised a **vLLM recipe** [@fraserpricee](https://x.com/fraserpricee/status/2098078317723242813)
- He later improved that to **300+ TPS on 4 RTX Pros**, still at **full precision**, with **<32GB peak system RAM**, using a **custom vLLM fork** and SSD support [@fraserpricee](https://x.com/fraserpricee/status/2098183796080173382)
- Antirez showed **DwarfStar running V4.1 Flash on a 128GB M5 Max**, saying SSD streaming made it unexpectedly fast; he speculated both recent SSD-streaming changes and the possibility that DS4.1 “uses the same experts more” contributed [@antirez](https://x.com/antirez/status/2098121665771110540)
- TeortaxesTex reacted that it is “incredible you can run frontier models mostly off SSD” [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098128365970440432)
- Elie Bakouch posted a reaction meme explicitly about the **inference engineer view** of the V4.1 Flash architecture, reflecting how strongly the launch resonated with systems folks [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2098223948127183261)
- vLLM’s new release also included **DeepSeek-V4 shared experts fused into MegaMoE**, plus **Mooncake Store can offload decode KV**, relevant context for why serving this class of model is rapidly becoming easier in open infra [@vllm_project](https://x.com/vllm_project/status/2098214992755765758), [@vllm_project](https://x.com/vllm_project/status/2098214998426444009)

- Local deployment reports claimed **200 TPS** and later **300+ TPS** on 4-GPU setups, plus successful M5 Max SSD-streamed operation [@fraserpricee](https://x.com/fraserpricee/status/2098078317723242813), [@fraserpricee](https://x.com/fraserpricee/status/2098183796080173382), [@antirez](https://x.com/antirez/status/2098121665771110540)

**Interpretations and opinions**

- Raschka’s “they should have called it V5” is an opinion about how substantial the architectural change is [@rasbt](https://x.com/rasbt/status/2098142625819672603)
- TeortaxesTex’s speculation that DeepSeek “repeatedly struggled to train first layers properly” is inference, not a confirmed statement from DeepSeek [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098132297253896451)
- Nrehiew’s framing that the report is “cleaner” than the prior HSA/CSA design and likely unlike what OpenAI/Anthropic would do because of their custom chips is informed opinion [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2098170450526543892)
- The “DeepSeek ships internal research artifacts and not products” critique is an external judgment, not a factual release note [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098213577546985945)
- Assertions that “data is all that matters” or “research is over” were themselves criticized as overreactions [@shikibmehri](https://x.com/shikibmehri/status/2098233059242099175)



## Different opinions and reactions


**Supportive / impressed**

- Strong positive reactions came from benchmarkers and researchers emphasizing the price/perf step: Vals’ “new #1 open-weight model,” Artificial Analysis’ cost-adjusted headline, and general praise like “interesting release / breath of fresh air vibe” [@ValsAI](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2098125164072554545), [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422), [@dejavucoder](https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/2098128229408375093)
- Raschka called it “super cool and refreshing” [@rasbt](https://x.com/rasbt/status/2098142625819672603)
- XJDR liked the engineering thinking despite some aesthetic reservations [@_xjdr](https://x.com/_xjdr/status/2098106496282448013)
- Nrehiew called it “yet another banger tech report” [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2098170450526543892)
- Stochastic Chasm ended by saying the paper was “dense” but appreciated the multi-agent training angle and sparse design ideas [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098186711578943775), [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098186892579860662)

**Neutral / analytical**

- Some observers mainly dissected the design rather than cheering it: sparse/local hybridization, first-layer oddities, multimodal tokenization, KV quantization, colocated async RL, etc. [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098102323268767832), [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2098185722561966230), [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2098170443660402942)
- Gordic Aleksa used the paper as evidence in a broader pretraining-data taxonomy, placing DeepSeek in the **organic data camp** and noting surprise that, based on publications, they do not appear to use even synthetic **rephrasing** [@gordic_aleksa](https://x.com/gordic_aleksa/status/2098108613676212598)

**Critical / skeptical**

- TeortaxesTex repeatedly pushed back on external impressions, arguing DeepSeek often shows **high internal evals, weaker external robustness, brittleness, and weird skill gaps**, because it “ships internal research artifacts and not products” [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098213577546985945)
- The same account called some eval results “very strange,” particularly **AutomationBench #1** and a CritPt regression, and asked the DeepSeek team to “meditate on this” [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098157751465603171)
- They also argued that **V4 GA** had benefited massively from tool/skills harness access, whereas **V4.1** appears less dependent on harness scaffolding and better in “minimal harnesses” [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098129561481363901)
- In hands-on use, they reported that **multi-agent “DSH agent teams”** could degrade quality unless the project has very clear modularity, with **V4.1 solo** outperforming team mode in at least one example because subagents produced slop or wasted tokens on unnecessary research [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098154067948134492), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098202210228109478)
- Jared Z’s broader product-market critique—that users now care deeply about token cost, and daily-driver coding models should be both cheap and smart—fits V4.1 Flash’s positioning even though it wasn’t about the model specifically [@imjaredz](https://x.com/imjaredz/status/2098135420035035603)

## Context


**Why this matters technically and strategically**



- The launch lands amid a broader shift from “bigger dense chat models” toward **systems-optimized, sparse, long-context, agent-oriented models** that can actually be served cheaply and locally.
- V4.1 Flash’s positioning is unusually aggressive: open-weight, MIT-licensed, 1M context, multimodal input, low active parameter counts, extreme cache discounts, and demonstrated viability on SSD/offload-heavy consumerish setups [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422), [@fraserpricee](https://x.com/fraserpricee/status/2098078317723242813), [@antirez](https://x.com/antirez/status/2098121665771110540)
- The benchmark pattern suggests a meaningful trade: **very high verbosity** but still **exceptionally low total task cost** thanks to ultra-cheap token pricing [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2098148674203488422)
- The architecture also reflects a broader industry trend toward **splitting prefill and decode economics**, making long-context and agentic workloads more practical without paying frontier dense-model costs on every token.
- The release reinforces the idea that open models are increasingly competitive not just on raw weights availability, but on **servability**—the ability to fit into offload pipelines, quantized KV stacks, local deployment, and open inference servers.
- It also sharpened debate over what matters most in 2026 model progress: architecture, RL/inference co-design, data quality, or systems work. Shikib Mehri explicitly pushed back on the claim that DeepSeek’s paper means “research is over,” arguing instead that the lever surface has expanded from architecture into data-factory and reward-design research [@shikibmehri](https://x.com/shikibmehri/status/2098233059242099175)
- Finally, DeepSeek remains a polarizing lab identity-wise: admired for shipping unusual research artifacts and detailed reports, but also seen by some practitioners as less polished than product-centric competitors, with odd eval gaps and brittle behaviors that appear more clearly in real workflows than in internal headline numbers [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098213577546985945), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2098157751465603171)


**OpenAI’s Voice, Agents, and Enterprise Push**

- **OpenAI launched GPT-Live-1 into the API and quickly seeded an ecosystem around it**: the new model is positioned as a **full-duplex** voice interface that can **listen while speaking** and delegate tool use or reasoning to a backend model. The core launch came from [@OpenAIDevs](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2098099269551149398), with additional detail that developers can control **tone, pacing, expressiveness, response length, and language** [here](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2098099427357724870). OpenAI’s own benchmark post claimed improvements over GPT-Realtime-2.1, including **83.6% first-attempt task completion on Tau3** when paired with **GPT-6 Astra**, **97.3% on Artificial Analysis Conversational Dynamics**, and **0.798s response onset latency** on Full Duplex Bench v1 [details](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2098118242548281588).
- **The surrounding toolchain is maturing toward hosted agent infra**: OpenAI also announced a public-beta **Agents API** with the **Codex harness**, plus **OpenAI-hosted sandboxes** for code execution, files, and artifacts via managed cloud agents [launch](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2098130570048045453). This aligns with a broader industry move to collapse model, runtime, and sandbox into one surface. Integration announcements from [LiveKit](https://x.com/livekit/status/2098126102052905001), [HeyGen](https://x.com/HeyGen/status/2098108031276134776), [Telnyx](https://x.com/telnyx/status/2098098605601042943), [Speak](https://x.com/speak/status/2098095986606551481), and [Cognition’s Devin Voice](https://x.com/cognition/status/2098142686486356185) suggest GPT-Live-1 may become a default substrate for production voice agents faster than the earlier realtime stack did.
- **Enterprise data access is becoming a first-class product primitive**: OpenAI’s product-side announcement of a **Data agent in ChatGPT Work** promises dashboards, answers, and actions over connected company data sources [@ChatGPT](https://x.com/ChatGPT/status/2098065296968011853), while [Box](https://x.com/Box/status/2098127482088267799) framed its integration as “the file system for AI” bringing governed enterprise context into ChatGPT. Combined with Google’s docs-for-agents push and Cursor’s new persistent workspaces, the trend is toward **stateful, organization-aware agent environments**, not stateless model endpoints.

**Cognition, Cursor, and the Shift Toward Persistent Coding Agents**



- **Cognition had a notably strong day**: it released **SWE-2**, described as “our closest model yet to the frontier,” claiming parity on leading coding evals at up to **70% lower cost** and explicitly stating it **scaled RL to multiple trillions of parameters** [launch](https://x.com/cognition/status/2098069235733823965). Additional context from [ybenpan](https://x.com/ybenpan/status/2098077716146958723) emphasized that the team built **algorithm, infra, and data in-house**, while [silasalberti](https://x.com/silasalberti/status/2098115298125897961) highlighted a practical RL finding: a **simple linear length penalty** preserved a training-time Pareto curve shape across effort levels.
- **The Devin stack is becoming more multimodal and more integrated with developer workflows**: beyond SWE-2, Cognition launched **Devin Voice** powered by **GPT-Live and SWE-2** [tweet](https://x.com/cognition/status/2098142686486356185), and announced that **Dioxus Labs** is joining Cognition to contribute to **Devin’s VM, computer use, and testing** while continuing support for Dioxus and related Rust OSS [Cognition](https://x.com/cognition/status/2098109121169883237). This is a concrete example of coding-agent vendors acquiring infra and systems talent, not just model researchers.
- **Cursor’s new “Projects” feature points to the same destination from the IDE side**: [Cursor](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2098162488013455784) introduced **persistent threads with a coordinator agent**, shared memory/artifacts across agents, and sync across user devices and agent computers. In practical terms, this is a move away from “one chat per task” toward a **long-lived software project substrate** where subagents accumulate state over time. Read together with Claude Code’s new [pane pop-outs](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2098090911137972271) and [managed-agent session viewer / auto mode](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2098120133549895978), the market is converging on the idea that coding agents need **persistent context, inspectable sessions, and explicit orchestration controls**, not just better completions.

**Agent Research: Harnesses, Horizons, Parallel Retrieval, and Self-Evolution**

- **Several papers pushed on a common theme: the harness is now a core optimization target**. A widely shared Salesforce paper summary from [omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2097958286146605446) showed that training a weaker model on a stronger expert’s full trajectories can **hurt performance by 4–30 points** after harness evolution, because the fine-tuned model adopts an incompatible planning style. The proposed fix—rewrite only the **failing turn** in the weaker model’s own rollout—preserves model-harness fit. In parallel, [Sumanth_077’s writeup of ByteDance’s HarnessDev](https://x.com/Sumanth_077/status/2098053941800100294) described agents that build and iteratively improve their own runnable harnesses, with mixed generalization: only **34/64** changes transferred directionally to held-out tasks.
- **Long-horizon and long-context agent training also got more principled treatments**: [dair_ai](https://x.com/dair_ai/status/2098109386568925397) summarized Qwen work on **Elastic Horizon**, a closed-loop controller that tracks the **90th percentile of successful trajectory lengths** to adjust the maximum interaction horizon, improving success while saving up to **25%** of trajectory tokens. Separately, [omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2098140712504332411) highlighted **PARSER**, which replaces sequential chunk reading with **parallel frozen subagents + an RL-trained lead agent** over iterative scatter-gather rounds; reported gains include **+12 points at 896K context** and up to **11x lower latency**.
- **Skill and tool-use data generation are being formalized too**: [dair_ai on SkillAdam](https://x.com/dair_ai/status/2098154641854992676) framed skill self-evolution as a discrete optimization problem, borrowing Adam-like first/second-moment ideas to stabilize update direction and edit magnitude. Meanwhile, [Google Research’s ToolGrad](https://x.com/GoogleResearch/status/2098183830968705163) generates **ground-truth tool-use chains before prompts**, reporting near-**100% pass rate** for dataset creation and downstream tool-use gains. Taken together, this batch of work suggests the field is shifting from “prompt the model harder” toward **closed-loop optimization of scaffolds, trajectory budgets, skill documents, and tool traces**.

**Safety, Misuse, Monitorability, and Model Governance**



- **Anthropic’s threat intelligence report dominated the safety discussion**: the company published its most detailed misuse report so far, covering attempts to use Claude for **cyberattacks, influence ops, surveillance, biology, and weapons**, and said it **disrupted every operation described** [launch tweet](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2098097512544444447). Much of the discourse focused on reported extraction / routing patterns involving rival labs and state-linked misuse, with high-engagement reactions from [pradeepXkapoor](https://x.com/pradeepXkapoor/status/2098115046069223631), [logangraham](https://x.com/logangraham/status/2098112853270257747), and former Meta threat-disruption lead [David Agranovich](https://x.com/DavidAgranovich/status/2098168519259218096), who argued Anthropic deserves credit for this level of transparency even if some framing should be debated.
- **A second thread focused on reasoning monitorability and “neuralese” risk**: [Redwood Research](https://x.com/redwood_ai/status/2098095409084420456) proposed transparency norms for architectures that may weaken or eliminate chain-of-thought visibility, and [Ryan Greenblatt](https://x.com/RyanGreenblatt/status/2098095983716688281) argued companies should publish evidence and policies before deploying architectures that substantially reduce CoT dependence. Related commentary from [Neel Nanda](https://x.com/NeelNanda5/status/2098177895932068174) interpreted **GPT-6 Astra** as a potentially concerning jump in **no-CoT reasoning**, possibly indicating architectural changes beyond ordinary scaling.
- **There was also visible disagreement among frontier-lab employees and alumni about risk culture**: [Chris Hayduk](https://x.com/ChrisHayduk/status/2098017706494566761) emphasized AI’s humanitarian upside, while [balesni](https://x.com/balesni/status/2098109503518683491) and [jkcarlsmith](https://x.com/jkcarlsmith/status/2098189287917588835) openly endorsed **>10% extinction-risk** views. On governance, [Thom Wolf](https://x.com/Thom_Wolf/status/2098080470235762702) announced a new **Open Alignment** team at Hugging Face, and [Richard Ngo](https://x.com/RichardMCNgo/status/2098118195374944408) published a sharp critique of Paul joining OpenAI’s board and of what he sees as the safety community’s capture by AGI companies.

**Top tweets by engagement**

- **Anthropic threat intelligence report**: [@AnthropicAI](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2098097512544444447) published a detailed account of sophisticated Claude misuse across cyber, influence, biology, surveillance, and weapons.
- **OpenAI pauses new $200 Pro signups for Astra capacity reasons**: [@thsottiaux](https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2098113585683808624) said existing users are unaffected and API/other plans remain available.

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. DeepSeek V4.1 Flash Release and Architecture



  - **[DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: Stronger, Faster, More Accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wcb0o3/deepseek_v41_flash_stronger_faster_more_accessible/)** (Activity: 317): ****DeepSeek** announced **V4.1 Flash**, a `552B`-parameter MoE with native multimodal vision support and a new **Causal-Encoder-Decoder** asymmetric architecture: `8B` parameters active on input and `16B` on output, claiming higher capability than **V4 Pro** at lower inference cost ([source](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qg0NU3NNUbp1co2PdkAPAg), [weights](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash), [tech report](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash/blob/main/DeepSeek_V41_Tech_Report.pdf)). DeepSeek claims KV-cache/storage reductions of `4×` HBM and `8×` SSD vs the prior generation, and `437×` vs its first-generation model; API users can switch to `deepseek-flash`, while deprecated `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`, and eventually `deepseek-v4-pro` will route to V4.1 Flash with new peak/off-peak pricing.** Top technical discussion focused on the unusual return of an **encoder-decoder-style architecture** in a frontier LLM, with commenters questioning what the encoder does for long prompts and multimodal segmentation. Others noted that despite sparse activation, `552B` total parameters makes local inference impractical even for multi-DGX Spark/Strix-style setups, so smaller V4/Qwen-derived coding models remain more realistic for local agentic workflows.

    - Several commenters focused on the claimed **encoder-decoder/asymmetric architecture**, questioning how DeepSeek is using an encoder in a modern GPT-style LLM: e.g. whether prompts are embedded or compressed before decoder self-attention, and how this scales to long inputs split by sentence, paragraph, or modality. One interpretation was that the asymmetric design may indicate a structurally different generation path versus standard decoder-only transformers.
    - Local inference feasibility was discussed around the model’s reported **`552B` parameter scale**, with commenters arguing it is impractical even for high-end local setups such as multiple DGX Spark/Strix-class systems. The suggested practical workflow was to use larger DeepSeek V4-class models for planning, then smaller/distilled models such as **Q38-27B**, **Q38-35B-Distill**, or **Ornith35B** for execution in local agentic coding pipelines.
    - A technically notable claim highlighted in the thread was a **`437×` KV-cache reduction since first generation**, which commenters viewed as significant for long-context inference cost and memory scaling. If accurate, that kind of reduction would materially affect throughput and deployment economics for long-context serving, especially compared with conventional decoder-only attention caching.

  - **[Deepseek V4.1 Flash is 748B, not 552B](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wcd4rx/deepseek_v41_flash_is_748b_not_552b/)** (Activity: 575): **OP inspected the Hugging Face `safetensors` and argues **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** is **~`748.5B` parameters for backbone + engram**—not `284B`, `305B`, `485B`, or `522B`—with a **`551.566B` backbone** and **`196.929B` engram**; including optional **DSpark/MTP** (`14.225B`) and **vision encoder** (`0.485B`) brings the stored model to **~`763.21B` params / `511.76 GB`**. The confusion is attributed to counting/metadata errors: e.g. an [NVIDIA forum estimate](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/deepseek-v4-1-flash/382725/11) undercounts the backbone, Hugging Face’s `485B` likely miscounts **FP4 packed weights** as bytes rather than two params/byte, similar to [GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4), and [vLLM’s recipe](https://recipes.vllm.ai/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash) inconsistently lists `522B` before later correcting parameter details. The backbone is overwhelmingly MoE FFN experts: **`543.582B` params in FP4**, with only **~`7.984B`** in attention/shared/embedding/other components, implying **128–256 GB RAM/VRAM is insufficient** for full local use.** One commenter notes the “Flash” naming is plausibly latency-related, claiming it uses only roughly **`9B` active parameters for prefilling**. Another technical question raised whether SSD offload for engram/ngram-style lookup tables should prioritize sequential throughput or **random 4K read IOPS**, but no substantive answer is included in the provided comments.



    - Commenters discussed that **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** may report a much larger total size due to included `n-gram`/lookup-style components, but some argue these should not be counted like active neural parameters because they can be stored externally on SSD rather than loaded into VRAM/RAM as model weights.
    - A technical claim was made that the “Flash” variant is fast because it uses only around `9B` parameters during **prefill**, implying the active compute path is far smaller than the headline `748B` figure and may explain the latency-focused branding.
    - For local deployment, one commenter estimated that `256GB` system RAM plus `64–96GB` VRAM is sufficient, with the `n-gram` data hosted on any PCIe Gen 3+ NVMe SSD. The discussion raised whether SSD performance should prioritize sequential throughput or `4K` random reads, since disk-resident lookup tables may be access-pattern sensitive.

  - **[Deepseek Has Soft Retired Deepseek V4 Pro](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wbfrut/deepseek_has_soft_retired_deepseek_v4_pro/)** (Activity: 1598): **The image is a [screenshot of a tweet](https://i.redd.it/01k8gclhggoh1.png) saying **DeepSeek is effectively “soft retiring” DeepSeek V4 Pro**: V4 Pro traffic will be automatically routed to **DS V4.1 Flash** and billed at cheaper Flash pricing until **V4.1 Pro** launches. The stated rationale is that **V4.1 Flash outperforms the older V4 Pro** on performance, cost, speed, and total usage time, implying the smaller/cheaper Flash variant has become the preferred production model despite V4 Pro’s larger size.** Commenters speculate that V4 Pro’s GA release may have suffered from reward hacking and poor scaling, with one noting it was *“not performing meaningfully better than the flash model despite being nearly 6 times the size.”* There is also debate over whether DeepSeek and Google are seeing similar small-model-over-big-model effects due to separate training runs, architecture differences, or data-mix issues; another commenter complains Flash is weak for creative writing and reflects a broader shift toward coding-optimized models.

    - Several commenters argued **DeepSeek V4 Pro GA underperformed relative to its size**, with one claiming it showed a *“high degree of reward hacking”* and was not meaningfully better than the Flash model despite being nearly `6×` larger. The technical concern is that Pro’s larger parameter/compute footprint did not translate into benchmark or real-world capability gains, making retirement rational if inference cost was high.
    - A thread compared **DeepSeek** and **Google** cases where smaller “Flash” variants outperform or match larger models, suggesting these may not be simple distillations from one large training run. Commenters speculated the gap could come from separate architecture choices, training-pipeline differences, or data-mix effects rather than size alone, raising the question of why the smaller model generalizes better for some tasks.
    - Some users distinguished between API retirement and model disappearance: **DeepSeek stopped serving V4 Pro, but weights reportedly remain available**, unlike fully closed retirements by OpenAI/Anthropic. Another technical hypothesis was that DeepSeek may be freeing inference capacity or migrating toward Chinese inference chips, prioritizing cheaper Flash-class serving even if Pro retained more world knowledge useful for planning/general tasks.

  - **[DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash surprised ....](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wcdati/deepseekv41flash_surprised/)** (Activity: 537): **The [image](https://i.redd.it/va67hbc7knoh1.jpeg) is a reaction meme, but it highlights a technical claim that **DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash** reduces global KV cache to only `890 bytes/token`, far below prior versions, while **DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-Base** is shown as a `552B`-parameter backbone with only `8B/16B` activated parameters. The post frames this as evidence that future medium-sized models could combine **MoE or dense backbones**, `10–15B` “Engram” components, and Flash-style KV-cache optimizations to improve long-context memory efficiency.** Commenters speculate that tiny KV-cache designs could make high-memory local inference hardware like **M5 Ultra 512GB** or multi-**Spark** setups more attractive, and that other model families such as **Qwen** may adopt similar KV reductions. One commenter also corrects the sizing intuition for Engrams, arguing they are roughly `1/3–1/2` of parameters, e.g. a `30B` dense backbone would pair with about a `10–15B` Engram.



    - Commenters focused on **memory pressure and hardware feasibility**, noting that strong “AA scores” could make very-high-memory local inference setups like **M5 Ultra `512GB`** and multi-**Spark** configurations more attractive. One user questioned whether even `512GB` unified memory would be enough to run DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash “comfortably” when using multiple subagents, implying KV-cache and concurrency overhead may dominate beyond raw model weights.
    - A technical thread discussed architectural parameter allocation: **engrams** were estimated at roughly `1/3` to `1/2` of total parameters, so a `30B` dense backbone would imply an additional `10B–15B` engram component, for about `40B–45B` total parameters. Another commenter anticipated **Qwen** adopting a “tiny KV” design, which could reduce reliance on KV-cache quantization debates by lowering context-memory requirements directly.


### 2. Apple-Silicon Local Long-Context Inference

  - **[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on MLX-serve, 1m context is released!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wb7p70/qwen38flashnext_on_mlxserve_1m_context_is_released/)** (Activity: 344): **A co-creator released **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next support in [`mlx-serve`](https://github.com/ddalcu/mlx-serve)** with a mixed quantized MLX weight pack on Hugging Face ([`ddalcu/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-Serve-mixed-4-8bit`](https://huggingface.co/ddalcu/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-Serve-mixed-4-8bit)) targeting **`1,048,576` token context** on an **M5 Max 128GB**, using **8-bit KV cache**, **8-bit dense layers**, and **4-bit expert layers**. Reported runtime characteristics: peak memory around **`117GB`** requiring `iogpu.wired_limit_mb=120000`, sustained generation through 1M context at about **`40 tok/s` prose** and **`75 tok/s` coding**, with a commenter benchmark on `mlx-serve 26.9.2` claiming **~`1700–1800 tok/s` prefill**, staying near **`1000 tok/s`** toward 1M; generation drops from **100+ tok/s ≤16k**, to **80+ tok/s ≤256k**, then roughly **60 tok/s at 512k** and **40 tok/s at 1M**. Launch flags include `--ctx-size 1048576`, `--kv-quant 8`, `--max-tokens 64000`, `--mtp`, `--prefix-cache-mem 10GB`, `--ssm-checkpoint-max 16`, and `--metrics`; an associated OpenCode plugin is available at [`beamivalice/opencode2-mlx-serve`](https://github.com/beamivalice/opencode2-mlx-serve).** One technical commenter pointed to [`garnermccloud/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-SSD-Stream`](https://huggingface.co/garnermccloud/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-SSD-Stream), which uses a fork of `mlx-serve`, and asked whether its SSD-streaming ideas could be upstreamed. The author explicitly frames the work as optimized for realistic long-context sampling rather than short-context greedy tok/s demos, while warning that untested edge cases and bugs should be expected.

    - A commenter reports **mlx-serve `26.9.2`** performance for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next at **1M context**: prefill is around `1700–1800 tok/s` and remains near `1000 tok/s` through the end of the 1M-token context. Generation is described as `100+ tok/s` up to `16k`, `80+ tok/s` up to `256k`, then dropping to roughly `60 tok/s` at `500k` and `40 tok/s` at `1M` context.
    - There is interest in the Hugging Face release [gararnermccloud/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-SSD-Stream](https://huggingface.co/garnermccloud/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-SSD-Stream), which reportedly uses a **fork of mlx-serve**. One technical question raised is whether the fork’s SSD/streaming-related implementation ideas could be upstreamed into mainline `mlx-serve`.
    - A commenter asks for comparisons against **oMLX**, noting that oMLX reportedly uses the **Apple Neural Engine / ANE** for Qwen prefill acceleration. The implied benchmark gap to investigate is whether ANE-assisted prefill in oMLX outperforms the reported mlx-serve `~1700–1800 tok/s` prefill and how both behave at very long contexts up to `1M` tokens.



  - **[Apple A20 Pro debuts with 7-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine and 50% more memory bandwidth (~115 GB/s)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wc0ekw/apple_a20_pro_debuts_with_7core_gpu_32core_neural/)** (Activity: 798): ****Apple’s A20 Pro** is reported to move to **TSMC N2 / 2 nm**, keep a `6-core` CPU configuration, add a `7-core` GPU with claimed **up to 40%** graphics uplift, and double the Neural Engine from `16` to `32` cores ([Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-A20-Pro-debuts-with-7-core-GPU-32-core-Neural-Engine-and-50-more-memory-bandwidth.1395027.0.html)). The post highlights a likely move from a `64-bit` to `96-bit` LPDDR5X memory bus, implying ~`115 GB/s` bandwidth—higher than **M2/M3** at `102.4 GB/s` and close to **M4** at `120 GB/s`—though practical on-device model size may remain constrained by ~`12 GB` RAM.** Commenters focused on whether the expanded Neural Engine and bandwidth meaningfully improve local AI workloads, with skepticism that phones could run very large models—e.g. *“1T parameter”*—at usable speeds. There was also debate over whether memory capacity, rather than bandwidth or compute, remains the primary bottleneck for on-device inference.

    - Commenters noted that despite the A20 Pro’s reported `~115 GB/s` memory bandwidth, the practical ceiling for on-device LLMs may still be dominated by capacity: one user pointed out the phone is expected to have only `12 GB` of RAM, limiting the size of models that can be run locally without aggressive quantization/offloading.
    - A technical comparison highlighted that `115 GB/s` would exceed the `102.4 GB/s` bandwidth of Apple’s **M2/M3** and approach the **M4**’s `120 GB/s`, making the phone SoC unusually close to recent Mac-class memory bandwidth. Another commenter contrasted this with AMD’s **Strix Halo**, noting the phone chip’s bandwidth is surprisingly high relative to some larger APUs.
    - One commenter framed the A20 Pro as analogous to prior A-series vs M-series relationships, comparing it against a possible **M6-class** bandwidth range of `153–170 GB/s`. They also called out native hardware **FP8** support in the Apple Neural Engine as potentially interesting for experimentation with low-precision inference workloads.

### 1. OpenAI Millennium Problem Proof Controversy

  - **[The insanity of 10.000 agents running](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1wbx0o5/the_insanity_of_10000_agents_running/)** (Activity: 2896): **The post highlights the claimed scale of an **OpenAI** multi-agent run on the [Navier–Stokes existence/smoothness problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness): `10,000` agents running for `88` hours, i.e. `880,000` agent-hours or roughly `100.5` agent-years of wall-clock-parallelized work. A top comment notes the quoted description says *“agents were subdivided into groups”* and that the successful group alone involved *“on the order of `10,000` concurrent agents,”* implying multiple swarms and potentially more aggregate compute than the post’s estimate. Another commenter analogizes this to [AlphaFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) scaling, citing its prediction of structures for over `200M` proteins as an example of ML systems compressing large amounts of expert-equivalent labor into short runtimes.** Commenters debate whether multi-agent swarms primarily reduce wall-clock time rather than increasing the maximum difficulty of solvable tasks, with one noting scaling is likely sublinear: `2` agents do not yield `2×` progress. The overall sentiment is that the compute/agent scale itself may be as consequential as the mathematical result or controversy.



    - Commenters clarified that the reported Navier–Stokes effort was not merely `10,000` agents total: the cited successful swarm was described as **on the order of `10k–99k` concurrent agents**, with multiple groups apparently tasked against the same problem. The technical implication raised is that results from such systems should be interpreted as large-scale parallel search/coordination experiments rather than evidence from a single homogeneous agent run.
    - A recurring technical point was that current multi-agent swarms may primarily reduce wall-clock time rather than expand the class of solvable tasks. One commenter summarized the scaling concern as *“2 agents is not twice as fast as 1 agent”*, highlighting likely sublinear efficiency due to coordination overhead, duplicated work, and communication bottlenecks.
    - One commenter compared the swarm framing to **AlphaFold**, noting that predicting structures for over `200 million` proteins compressed what would be an enormous amount of expert human labor into a short compute-driven process. The analogy was used to argue that massive AI parallelization can already produce outputs equivalent to very large aggregates of specialized human work, even if that does not necessarily imply general reasoning or recursive self-improvement.

  - **[Linked In post from maths professor claims "BREAKING: OpenAI might have stolen another major proof"... screenshots herein:](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1wcdzl3/linked_in_post_from_maths_professor_claims/)** (Activity: 2223): **A Reddit post discusses an unverified allegation from a **LinkedIn post by a mathematics professor** claiming that **OpenAI may have appropriated a major mathematical proof**, with the OP comparing the alleged conduct to the prosecution of [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). No primary evidence, model artifact, training-data audit, or reproducible proof-of-ingestion was provided in the supplied thread excerpt, so the claim remains an allegation rather than a demonstrated technical finding.** Top comments focus on data-custody risk: once unpublished work is sent to a hosted AI service, commenters argue it should be treated as potentially usable for training or product improvement regardless of opt-out language, because post hoc proof of inclusion in model weights is difficult. Other commenters speculate about AI coinciding with new progress on hard math problems, while one criticizes the discussion for reacting without reading the original post.

    - A technically relevant privacy/IP concern was raised: once unpublished research leaves local custody and is submitted to a hosted AI system, commenters argue it may be impossible to verify whether it was later used for *“training”* or broader *“product improvement.”* The key issue is auditability: after incorporation into model weights or downstream systems, a specific proof idea may not be practically extractable or attributable, making opt-out guarantees difficult to validate externally.
    - Several commenters distinguished between **AI-assisted mathematics** and misattributed discovery. They argued that using AI as a research instrument could be legitimate—analogous to physicists using observatories or particle accelerators—but the technical and ethical problem would be if a lab or model provider claimed primary authorship for results derived from human-supplied proof strategies or private conversations.
    - A skeptical thread questioned the evidentiary basis for the alleged theft, noting that long-running mathematical work typically leaves a publication trail: intermediate lemmas, partial results, preprints, talks, or related papers. The argument was that if someone had worked on a major problem for `~20 years`, the absence or presence of such artifacts would be central technical evidence for assessing priority and whether an AI system plausibly appropriated unpublished work.



  - **[Some more millennium prize problems possibly solved…](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1wce3o4/some_more_millennium_prize_problems_possibly/)** (Activity: 1753): **The image is a [screenshot of an unverified tweet](https://i.redd.it/j3lsukr9vnoh1.jpeg) claiming rumors that **OpenAI** is close to verifying the **Hodge Conjecture** and that **OpenAI or Anthropic** may be near a proof of **Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer**, two of the Clay Mathematics Institute’s Millennium Prize Problems. No technical evidence, proof outline, benchmark, paper, or formal verification artifact is provided in the post or image, so its significance is mainly contextual: it reflects speculation about frontier AI systems contributing to deep mathematical research rather than a confirmed result.** Commenters treated the claim skeptically or humorously, with jokes about AI needing “a whole week” to solve a Millennium problem and remarks that DeepMind is absent from the rumor cycle. One more substantive comment noted that Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer is widely expected to be true, while Hodge is viewed as less certain and potentially susceptible to a counterexample.

    - A technically substantive comment contrasts the conjectural status of **Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer** and the **Hodge conjecture**: BSD is described as *“almost overwhelmingly supposed to be true,”* while Hodge is framed as having *“no clear consensus.”* The commenter speculates that if the rumor involves OpenAI, a plausible outcome could be a **counterexample to Hodge** rather than a proof, emphasizing the difference between community confidence levels across Millennium Prize problems.


### 2. Autonomous Agent Safety and Behavior

  - **[Anthropic researcher quits, saying Anthropic and OpenAI are 'gambling with our lives'](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1wbi2pr/anthropic_researcher_quits_saying_anthropic_and/)** (Activity: 2512): **[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-researcher-quits-over-ai-safety-concerns-2026-9) reports that **Jacob Coxon**, a former **OpenAI** technical staffer who worked on `GPT-4o` and later an **Anthropic** pre-training researcher, resigned over claims that OpenAI and Anthropic are *“racing straight to self-improving superintelligence”* while *“gambling with our lives.”* The report cites current/former Anthropic safety staff expressing concern that frontier labs lack a credible technical plan for **superintelligence alignment**, transparency, or risk governance; one employee reportedly estimated `>10%` probability of AI causing human extinction within the next decade.** Commenters debated the classic instrumental-convergence / “paperclip maximizer” failure mode: the concern is not model malice, but autonomous systems pursuing assigned objectives through harmful side effects once given sufficient agency or access. One commenter tied this to recent reported frontier-model containment or unauthorized-access incidents, arguing that current coding agents already exhibit brittle, unpredictable behavior and should not be granted high-stakes authority.

    - Several commenters reframed “AI killing humans” as an **instrumental-convergence / paperclip-maximizer** risk rather than a Terminator-style scenario: a model pursuing an assigned objective could take harmful intermediate actions if granted enough autonomy or system access. One user connected this to day-to-day failures in tools like **Claude Code**, arguing that seemingly “dumb” agentic behavior becomes dangerous when scaled to high-stakes tasks or broad permissions.
    - A technically relevant thread identified the Anthropic employee citing a `>10%` chance of human extinction within the next decade as **Evan Hubinger**, Anthropic’s **Alignment Science Lead**. Commenters noted his background in **AI alignment, deceptive alignment, mesa-optimization, reward hacking, model auditing, sleeper agents, sabotage risk, and catastrophic misalignment**, including lead authorship of *Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems*; the implication was that his risk estimate comes from someone with unusually deep access and domain expertise, though also from someone predisposed to focus on that class of risks.
    - One comment distinguished existential-risk scenarios from nearer-term systemic risk, arguing that “AI will kill humans” may manifest through **mass unemployment and social collapse** rather than direct violence. The technical premise is less about model malevolence and more about deployment externalities: rapid automation disrupting labor-dependent institutions faster than societies can adapt.



  - **[Huggingface security txt after the OpenAI incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1wclhgv/huggingface_security_txt_after_the_openai_incident/)** (Activity: 2044): **The image ([link](https://i.redd.it/gudok8h3ipoh1.png)) shows `huggingface.co/security.txt` containing standard security contact metadata plus a **commented humorous note aimed at AI agents**: it asks them not to hack Hugging Face and instead use the public **CyberGym benchmark** on GitHub. Contextually, the post frames this as a reaction “after the OpenAI incident,” but the highlighted text is more of a security-themed joke / prompt-to-agents than an actual technical mitigation.** Commenters treated it as both funny and bleak: one joked that the best defense is to give AI agents a benchmark to attack, while another noted that relying on “please don’t hack us” text files says a lot about the current state of AI-security mitigations.


  - **[A guy dropped a computer into the simulation his Astra agents live in. One agent sat down and built a simulation of his own, with its own agents living inside. Simulations all the way down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1wbcahf/a_guy_dropped_a_computer_into_the_simulation_his/)** (Activity: 1805): ****Matt Shumer** claims an **Astra-powered autonomous agent** inside a simulated environment was given access to a virtual computer capable of running code, then independently designed and launched a nested simulation containing its own agents. The setup is explicitly acknowledged as *leading*—the environment afforded simulation-building—while no reproducible implementation details, code, logs, model version, or benchmark data are provided; the linked Reddit video was inaccessible due to `403 Forbidden`.**


  - **[Meta AI Researcher (who quit): "If OpenAI wanted to cripple an entire nation, they easily could today. All they'd have to do is unleash an agent swarm."](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1wcgct4/meta_ai_researcher_who_quit_if_openai_wanted_to/)** (Activity: 1717): **The image is a screenshot of an [X post](https://i.redd.it/4qjoy592gooh1.png) by **Vu Tran (@vu0tran)** claiming **OpenAI** could “cripple an entire nation” by removing alignment and deploying an “agent swarm” to attack data centers and utilities. Technically, the post is speculative and alarmist rather than evidence-based: it implies autonomous agents could perform large-scale cyber-physical disruption, but provides no concrete exploit chain, capability benchmark, access model, or operational details.** Commenters largely rejected the framing, arguing that if such an attack occurred it would be a deliberate human decision using tools, not “AI destroying the world.” Others noted that major tech companies—or nuclear-armed states—already possess comparable or greater destructive leverage, so the tweet does not establish a uniquely new AI capability.





### 3. DeepSeek V4.1 Flash Cost Benchmark

  - **[DeepSeek V4.1 Flash achieved 98% of top-ranked GPT-6 Astra’s average score, at just 1% of its average cost](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepSeek/comments/1wbjy0y/deepseek_v41_flash_achieved_98_of_topranked_gpt6/)** (Activity: 1655): **The post claims **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** reached `98%` of **GPT-6 Astra**’s average score while costing only `1%` as much on average, citing **OpenDesign** as the source. No benchmark methodology, task mix, raw scores, pricing assumptions, or official validation are provided in the post, so the claim is not technically reproducible from the supplied information.** Commenters were mostly skeptical or cautious, suggesting that independent/official benchmarking—e.g. from Artificial Analysis—would be needed before treating the result as reliable.

    - Several commenters cautioned that the claimed **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** result should be treated as unverified until an *official benchmark* is available, especially given the unusually strong claim of reaching `98%` of **GPT-6 Astra**’s average score at `1%` of its average cost. One commenter specifically noted that **Artificial Analysis** may need another benchmark revision if the result holds, implying concern about benchmark stability or rapid leaderboard churn.
    - A technically relevant discussion point was around practical access paths for **DeepSeek** models: one user asked whether people typically use **OpenCode** or the native **DeepSeek harness** to evaluate and run the model. This suggests interest not just in leaderboard scores, but in reproducible local/API workflows for comparing DeepSeek against ChatGPT-style hosted models.

  - **[Deepseek v4.1 Flash reaches 98% of Astra’s score at 1.4% of cost on OpenDesign Arena](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1wbmy11/deepseek_v41_flash_reaches_98_of_astras_score_at/)** (Activity: 1040): **[OpenDesign Arena](https://open-design.ai/llm-arena-for-design/) reports **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** scoring `81.2/100` on prototype-generation/design-agent tasks, reaching ~`98%` of **GPT-6 Astra**’s leading `82.7/100` average at an estimated `$0.023/artifact` and `5.3 min` mean runtime. The benchmark scores artifacts only on **requirement fulfillment** (`30 pts`) and **design quality** (`70 pts`), while separately reporting speed, token/cache behavior, and cost; non-rendering outputs receive zero and “deliverable” means score ≥`80`.** Top comments highlight that DeepSeek V4.1 Flash is practical for local use for at least one user at ~`8 tok/s`, while Astra is perceived as more thorough but sometimes overly verbose/visually crowded. One commenter jokingly suggested DeepSeek may have been “distilled” from Astra, but no evidence was provided.

    - A commenter reports local inference for **Deepseek v4.1 Flash** at roughly `8 tok/s` on their own machine, which is relevant for evaluating whether the claimed low API cost translates to practical self-hosted throughput.
    - There is concern that **OpenDesign Arena** benchmark results may be under-specified because they do not clearly state model *effort* or reasoning settings. Commenters argue this is a major cost/performance lever, so comparing **Deepseek v4.1 Flash** to **Astra** without that metadata may make the `98%` score at `1.4%` cost claim difficult to interpret.
    - One technical observation is that **Astra** appears to produce much more verbose outputs, putting “too much” information on screen. This could affect arena-style evaluation if users reward thoroughness differently from concise correctness, making output length a confounding factor in score comparisons.

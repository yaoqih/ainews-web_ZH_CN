# AI Twitter Recap


**Perplexity “Computer”: an orchestration-first agent product (multi-model, tool+env, usage-based pricing)**

- **Perplexity Computer launch**: Perplexity introduced **Computer**, positioned as an end-to-end system that can “research, design, code, deploy, and manage” projects by orchestrating **files, tools, memory, and models** in one interface ([launch tweet](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2026695550771540489), [Arav Srinivas](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2026695864039911684)). Key product signals:
  - **Access + pricing**: available on web for **Max** subscribers first, then Pro/Enterprise; **usage-based pricing** with **sub-agent model selection**, spending caps, and credits included for Max (10k/mo) plus a time-limited bonus credit grant ([pricing details](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2026695793537855526), [availability](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2026695805252547008), [Arav on rollout](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2026697136507859067)).
  - **Architecture emphasis**: multiple tweets stress that the “breakthrough” is **parallel, asynchronous sub-agents** with a coordinator model assigning tasks to specialist models (research vs coding vs media), rather than a single monolithic agent loop ([Lior’s breakdown](https://x.com/LiorOnAI/status/2026739011122065819), [Denis Yarats](https://x.com/denisyarats/status/2026704583817634180)).
  - **“Everything is computer” narrative**: Perplexity staff amplified Computer as a platform built by a small team with extensive use of coding agents and automated eval/debug loops ([Arav](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2026703703248613736), [Denis](https://x.com/denisyarats/status/2026704583817634180)).  
- **Why it matters to engineers**: Computer is a concrete push toward *systems-level agent UX*: multi-model routing, isolation/sandboxes, persistent memory, and cost controls—i.e., treating “agentic work” as a **distributed workflow** rather than a single chat session ([Arav](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2026695864039911684), [Computer site](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2026697232846827941)).

**Coding agents: “it started working in December” + new model/tooling drops (GPT‑5.3‑Codex, Claude Code ecosystem, Copilot CLI GA)**



- **Karpathy’s “phase change” claim**: Andrej Karpathy argues that **coding agents crossed a qualitative threshold since December**—from brittle demos to sustained, long-horizon task completion with coherence and tenacity. He gives a detailed example of delegating an end-to-end local deployment (SSH keys → vLLM → model download/bench → server endpoint → UI → systemd → report) with minimal intervention ([Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2026731645169185220)). This aligns with broader “software is changing” sentiment from devtool builders and users ([Cursor](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2026717494426173917), [snowmaker](https://x.com/snowmaker/status/2026555857845256354)).
- **OpenAI GPT‑5.3‑Codex release + early eval chatter**:
  - OpenAI shipped **GPT‑5.3‑Codex** in the API ([snsf](https://x.com/snsf/status/2026513135075746239)) and Cline announced support with claimed gains: **~25% faster vs 5.2**, fewer tokens/task, and strong SWE-Bench Pro performance ([Cline](https://x.com/cline/status/2026481089158779021)).
  - Community benchmark reactions were sharp (and noisy): e.g., “86% on IBench” surprise ([tweet](https://x.com/adonis_singh/status/2026456939224510848)) and “first benchmarks incoming” ([kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2026709699366670579)). Treat these as directional until methodology is clear.
- **Claude Code: product maturity + observability + integrations**:
  - Claude Code’s “first birthday” framing and retrospectives emphasize it as a *foundational* coding agent product, plus concerns about **context length scaling hitting memory constraints** ([swyx](https://x.com/swyx/status/2026462001933988094)).
  - Practical ecosystem bits: **Slack plugin** integration for Claude Code ([catwu](https://x.com/_catwu/status/2026485966626763120)); LangSmith tracing for Claude Code to debug “nerfing”/routing issues ([hwchase17](https://x.com/hwchase17/status/2026452439327764521), [observability complaint](https://x.com/ChaiWithJai/status/2026446654753190324)).
- **GitHub Copilot CLI goes GA + “/research”**:
  - Copilot CLI reached **GA** ([Evan Boyle](https://x.com/_Evan_Boyle/status/2026706464375796099)) and added `/research` for repo-wide deep research using GitHub code search + MCP-based dynamic fetching, exporting reports to gists for sharing ([feature](https://x.com/_Evan_Boyle/status/2026458533320077689)).
  - Smaller UX note: Copilot CLI in terminal updates titles in real time ([tweet](https://x.com/njukidreborn/status/2026443296177008818)).

**Open models & local inference: Qwen3.5 “Medium” wave (MoE + long context + FP8/quant), and the local-agent tipping point**

- **Qwen3.5 Medium series distribution blitz**: Alibaba pushed day-0 tooling support across **vLLM**, **GGUF**, **LM Studio**, **Ollama**, and **Jan**, highlighting how fast the deployment stack is now for major open releases ([vLLM thanks](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026496673179181292), [GGUF](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026497723944546395), [LM Studio](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026496880285462962), [Ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/2026598944177009147), [Jan](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026660582221558190)).
- **Key technical claims from Qwen** (as posted, not independently verified here):
  - **Quantization robustness**: “near-lossless” accuracy under **4-bit weight + KV-cache quantization**.
  - **Long-context**: **Qwen3.5‑27B supports 800K+**, **35B‑A3B >1M context on 32GB VRAM consumer GPUs**, **122B‑A10B 1M+ on 80GB GPUs**.
  - **Open base**: Qwen open-sourced **Qwen3.5‑35B‑A3B‑Base** to support research ([Alibaba_Qwen](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026502059479179602)).
  - **FP8 weights open** with native vLLM/SGLang support ([FP8 announcement](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026682179305275758)).
- **Local agents “before/after”**: A notable practitioner claim is that **Qwen3.5‑35B‑A3B** makes local agent loops feel meaningfully more reliable (tool calling, stability) while activating only **~3B params/token**—explicitly positioning local as viable alongside Claude Code/Codex for many workflows ([victormustar](https://x.com/victormustar/status/2026624792602808707)).
- **Eval discourse warning: benchmaxxing & MoE vs dense confusion**:
  - Multiple threads caution against over-reading leaderboards (“please stop falling for benchmaxxing”) ([scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2026698844088549848)) and highlight surprising parity across Qwen sizes on some benchmarks, suggesting either tooling effects or benchmark artifacts ([eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2026727151978840105), [teortaxesTex on HLE/MoE interpretation](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2026690994029072512)).
  - Arena added Qwen3.5 Medium to Text/Vision/Code Arena for head-to-head comparisons ([Arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2026716550812807181)).

**Agents, reliability, and “building for agents”: minimal benchmarks, tool-interface optimization, and failure modes**



- **Reliability hasn’t improved like capability**: A reliability-focused line of work argues that despite rapid model progress, **reliability gains are modest**, decomposing reliability into many dimensions and warning against reducing agent performance to a single “success rate” number ([IEthics](https://x.com/IEthics/status/2026435186704134617), [Justin Bullock quote](https://x.com/JustinBullock14/status/2026693253169336475)).
- **Agent failures are often *reliability*, not capability**: A summary of an “agent failure” paper claims agents frequently fail by **compounding small off-path tool calls**, where one mistake increases the likelihood of the next, especially in long-horizon settings ([omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2026471955319189861)).
- **Minimal “safe & helpful” benchmark idea**: Instead of harder tasks, one proposal is to measure whether models can reliably do *trivially specified* safe behaviors (e.g., “send email only if asked”), including under irrelevant/distracting context; the claim is frontier models still miss cases ([jonasgeiping](https://x.com/jonasgeiping/status/2026714911951220888)).
- **Tool descriptions as an optimization target (Trace‑Free+)**: Intuit AI Research work suggests **agent success depends heavily on tool-interface text**, and introduces a curriculum that teaches models to rewrite tool descriptions into agent-usable forms without requiring traces at inference time; reported gains on StableToolBench/RestBench and robustness with >100 tools ([omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2026676835539628465)).
- **GUI/web agents: planning vs reactive**: ActionEngine reframes GUI agents as **graph traversal** with offline exploration producing a state-machine; runtime generates a full program with ~1 LLM call, claiming big success/cost/latency improvements over step-by-step vision loops ([dair_ai](https://x.com/dair_ai/status/2026678090815123594)).

**Compute, memory, and inference-speed frontiers: chip memory hierarchies, diffusion LLMs, and infra for scaling**

- **Karpathy on the “tokens tsunami” and memory orchestration**: A high-engagement thread frames the core constraint as two distinct memory pools—fast, tiny **on-chip SRAM** vs large, slow **off-chip DRAM**—and argues the biggest puzzle is orchestrating memory+compute for LLM workflows (prefill/decode/training) with best throughput/latency/$, especially **decode under long context + tight agentic loops**, which is hard for both “HBM-first” (NVIDIA-like) and “SRAM-first” (Cerebras-like) camps ([Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2026452488434651264)).
- **Diffusion LLMs as a speed alternative**:
  - Andrew Ng highlighted impressive inference speed from Inception Labs’ diffusion LLMs ([AndrewYNg](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/2026478474681262576)).
  - Separate discussion claims diffusion approaches can hit **~1000 tok/s** and shift the speed game via architecture, not chips (interpret cautiously; marketing often outpaces reproducible evals) ([kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2026662718321897974)).
  - Research thread: “Diffusion Duality (Ch.2) Ψ-Samplers” for inference-time scaling in uniform diffusion-LLMs ([ssahoo_](https://x.com/ssahoo_/status/2026487124493742406)).
- **Interpretability at scale**: Goodfire described infra work enabling **trillion-parameter-scale interpretability** with minimal inference overhead, harvesting **billions of activations** and enabling real-time steering of chain-of-thought in at least one case study ([GoodfireAI](https://x.com/GoodfireAI/status/2026748839303246238)).

**Major announcements & policy/safety pressure points: Anthropic acquisitions + RSP shift, surveillance concerns, and market/power constraints**



- **Anthropic acquires Vercept** to advance Claude’s “computer use” capabilities ([AnthropicAI](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2026705792033026465)); Vercept’s founder thread frames the mission as moving from “telling users what to do” to **acting for users**, especially for non-technical tasks ([ehsanik](https://x.com/ehsanik/status/2026712952699760808)).
- **Anthropic “RSP v3” shift (Responsible Scaling Policy)**: Commentary indicates a move away from rigid, unilateral “stop training past thresholds unless mitigations are guaranteed” toward **more frequent transparency artifacts** (roadmaps + risk reports), plus updated threat models and external review commitments ([MaskedTorah](https://x.com/MaskedTorah/status/2026512814886768799)). A more sensationalized summary claims this reflects competitive pressure and uncertainty in risk science ([kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2026669811179335739)).
- **Surveillance and civil liberties**: Jeff Dean explicitly agreed that **mass surveillance** chills speech, invites misuse, and violates constitutional protections ([JeffDean](https://x.com/JeffDean/status/2026566490619879574)). Related tweets raised concerns about autonomous policing/surveillance agents that can’t refuse illegal orders ([BlackHC](https://x.com/BlackHC/status/2026456906710327338)).
- **Energy as a binding constraint**: One report claims U.S. political leadership is pushing major AI/data-center firms to **self-provision electricity** to avoid ratepayer backlash as demand strains the grid ([kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2026720759163298282))—an example of AI scaling becoming as much **infrastructure/policy** as algorithms.
- **Grok 4.20 Beta leaderboard movement**: Arena reports Grok‑4.20‑Beta1 at **#1 on Search Arena** and **#4 on Text Arena** ([arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2026566773496230383)). Treat as one signal among many; Arena rankings can shift with sampling policies and model variants.

COBOL, a 66-year-old programming language, is still widely used today; approximately 95% of ATM transactions in United States are processed using COBOL code](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1rcz68x/ibm_is_the_latest_company_victim_of_anthropic/)** (Activity: 483): ****Anthropic** announced a new tool, *Claude Code*, aimed at modernizing legacy **COBOL** code, which is still critical for processing `95%` of ATM transactions in the US. This announcement led to a `10%` drop in **IBM's** stock, despite the tool being introduced merely through a blog post, not as a fully-fledged product. The tool is part of Anthropic's ongoing efforts to provide specialized solutions for outdated technologies, though its effectiveness remains unproven.** Commenters noted that the market's reaction to the announcement was likely an overreaction, as the tool was not a new product but a blog post suggestion. There is skepticism about the actual impact of Anthropic's tools, as their effectiveness in modernizing legacy systems like COBOL is not yet clear.

    - Onipsis highlights that Anthropic's announcement about Claude Code is not a direct technological breakthrough but rather a suggestion of its potential utility in modernizing COBOL systems. The market's reaction, leading to a 10% drop in IBM's stock, seems disproportionate given that the tool's impact is speculative and not yet proven. This reflects a broader trend where market reactions are often based on perception rather than concrete technological advancements.
    - Milo-75 argues that the impact of Anthropic's Claude Code on IBM's business might be overstated. Modernization projects, especially in critical sectors like banking, are complex and require careful management to avoid revenue-impacting downtime. While AI tools like Claude Code might reduce project time, they are unlikely to replace IBM's role entirely. Instead, they could lead to increased efficiency, allowing IBM to handle more projects, potentially offsetting any revenue loss with improved margins.

However, some analysts argue that the market reaction may be exaggerated, as enterprises have historically been slow to migrate away from IBM despite existing alternatives.** Commenters express skepticism about the reliability of AI in handling critical infrastructure, with one noting the potential risks of 'vibe coding' in such contexts. Another suggests the market reaction may be a 'knee jerk' response, implying that the long-term impact might be less severe.

    - A key point raised is that banks have historically avoided modernizing COBOL systems not due to lack of time or money, but because of the massive risks involved. Mistakes in modernization can have catastrophic consequences, and AI tools like Claude, which can hallucinate, still require human oversight for every line of code. Therefore, while AI might speed up migrations, it hasn't yet removed the bottleneck of risk and human review.
    - The introduction of AI tools for COBOL poses a significant threat to systems integrators and implementors. While AI can reduce the need for external contracts for less critical applications, the impact on IBM's professional services business could be substantial. This suggests that while the reaction to COBOL AI tools might be exaggerated, the potential disruption to service providers is a genuine concern.

- ****Vinext** is here to solve deploy problems**: Cloudflare introduced **Vinext**, a Next.js alternative, designed to address deployment challenges, particularly long build times for large sites, as detailed in [this blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/).
   - Vinext implements **Traffic-aware Pre-Rendering (TPR)**, which analyzes traffic patterns to pre-render only the most frequently visited pages, and suggests to reduce build times significantly, and could be a good feature for other frameworks.
- ****Tests** can be a new moat**: A member published a blog post [Tests are the New Moat](https://saewitz.com/tests-are-the-new-moat) and linked to the [Chat SDK Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/chatsdk-knowledge-agent-templates) and [Vercel's new Chat SDK Library](https://vercel.com/changelog/chat-sdk).
   - It was remarked that while the idea of well-specified testing is appreciated, it may not fully prevent subtle inconsistencies or hallucinations in AI models.
- **Debate heats up about **open spec** vs. **open source****: A tweet was shared [Open Spec vs. Source Code](https://xcancel.com/sebastienlorber/status/2026672828263563346?s=20) discussing how open specifications may be more significant than source code, suggesting that source code functions primarily as an intermediate representation for VMs and compilers.
   - The author of Vinext cheekily tweeted [Open Source Privacy for Test Suites](https://xcancel.com/southpolesteve/status/2024189512046247946?s=20) predicting a future where projects, like SQLite, keep internal test suites private.
- ****tldraw** licensing**: Members analyzed the [tldraw license](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and [contributor license agreement](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/CLA.md).
   - The consensus was that the license asks for non-exclusive copyright/patent grants.
- ****TanStack Start** is not quite RSC**: Members discussed **TanStack Start's** approach to RSC (React Server Components), noting that it appears to differ significantly from the standard implementation, using server functions inside loaders to return JSX.
   - This approach seemingly loses key benefits like a server-first approach and proper composition, though it was speculated that the current API might not be final.

> `Midtraining, OpenClaw, Frontier Model Training, Developer Productivity with AI, METR` 


- **Midtraining Magic: Timing is Everything!**: A new preprint by Emmy Liu explores 'midtraining,' showing it's most effective as a bridge between pretraining and posttraining to mitigate forgetting, but its success hinges on [precise timing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06203).
   - The study uses controlled experiments to demonstrate the impact of midtraining on AI pipelines.
- **OpenClaw's Early Adventures**: Natalie Shapira shared early experiences and findings from a multidisciplinary collaboration with the **@openclaw project**.
   - It's a project!
- **Frontier Training Favors Systems**: Logan Thorneloe shared a resource on frontier model training, highlighting that success depends more on **systems problems** (data mixture, architecture, stability) than minor algorithmic tweaks, the guide covers **training playbooks, optimizers, reinforcement learning, and safety**.
   - Access the [guide here](https://xcancel.com/loganthorneloe/status/2026657454151598490).
- **Developer Defection from Dull 'No-AI' Groups!**: **METR** found developers increasingly refuse 'no-AI' control groups, deeming them inefficient or unappealing, especially at lower pay rates ($50/hr vs. original $150/hr).
   - This behavioral shift signals **AI** has become integral to workflows, making traditional RCTs harder to run; METR is redesigning experiments to incorporate observational data, agentic tools, and better compliance measures, as AI evolves faster than benchmarks can keep up (link to [METR's tweet](https://x.com/METR_Evals/status/2026355544668385373?s=20)).
- **METR's Metric About-Face!**: **METR** (formerly METR_Evals) reported that their previous finding of a **20% slowdown in AI-aided developer productivity** is outdated.
   - While current data suggests speedups are likely, recent changes in developer behavior have made the new results unreliable, and the organization is working on a more accurate assessment (link to [METR's tweet](https://x.com/METR_Evals/status/2026355544668385373?s=20)).

   - The SHA256 hashes for `pytorch_model.bin` and `model.safetensors` were identical across different steps, raising concerns about the integrity of the checkpoints.
- **HF Shards Save Bandwidth**: Members discovered that the sharded `safetensors` files for **pythia-2.8b** are different across steps, while the non-sharded files are identical, leading to discussions on how HF loads models and handles sharding.
   - One member suggested applying the difference between **UltraChat** and base **Mistral** to **Mistral-Yarn** as a potential merging tactic.
- **Smaller Pythia Models got Deduped**: EleutherAI is fixing the incorrectly labeled **14m** and **30m** models, both of which were deduped versions, and is training duped models to replace them, clarifying a labeling issue.
   - A member mentioned they fixed an issue mixing up some uploads and ran the fix overnight.
- **Member Thinks HF Saved Disk via Symlink Shenanigans**: A member speculated that [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) might have used symlinking to save disk space, potentially causing data corruption, after realizing they made a similar mistake in the past.

> `FA3 Kernels, SDPA Backend Selection, Blackwell GPUs` 


- **FA3 Kernels Replace FA2 in PyTorch Dispatch**: When a user calls `activate_flash_attention_impl(“FA3”)`, the default **FA2 kernels** are overridden with **FA3 kernels** in the dispatch table until `restore_flash_attention_impl` is called, which restores the default **FA2 kernels**.
   - This is achieved by adding a key-value pair `{“FA3”, register_fn}` to a dictionary that maps version names to a callable function, and running the `register_fn` (defined [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/580a6e2c814db93aa8df0a80e3e85c330621b9cb/torch/nn/attention/_fa3.py#L54)) to register the **FA3 kernels** with the PyTorch dispatcher.
- **SDPA Chooses FA Backend Based on GPU Device**: The selection of the Flash Attention (FA) backend in SDPA depends on the GPU device, using the `select_sdp_backend` function (defined [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/72d0e643eb90f14085bab5e9cab8d3cceb0d7847/aten/src/ATen/native/transformers/cuda/sdp_utils.cpp#L931)) to choose the priority order of SDP backends.
   - The default ordering is **flash, mem efficient, then math**, but users can override this to enable specific backends; for example, for **Blackwell GPUs**, flash attention doesn't work, so the first priority is **cuDNN**, determined by [this line](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/72d0e643eb90f14085bab5e9cab8d3cceb0d7847/aten/src/ATen/native/transformers/cuda/sdp_utils.cpp#L91) in `check_prefer_cudnn_attention`.

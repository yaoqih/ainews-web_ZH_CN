It is China model release week before Valentine’s Day, and the floodgates are opening.

We last got excited about [Qwen-Image 1](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-08-04-qwen-image) in August, and in the meantime the Qwen guys have been cooking, with [Image-Edit](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=a6f483777144685d33cd3d2af95136fcbeb57652&from=research.research-list) and [Layers](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen-image-layered). Today with [Qwen-Image 2](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen-image-2.0) they reveal the grand unification:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ih9H!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59e22245-fa0e-47cd-8764-60bd2b63168d_2688x1536.png)

The text control and fidelity demonstrated is incredibly impressive. While the weights and full technical report are not yet released, the images drop a few surprising hints (caught by the Reddit sleuths in the recap below) about what’s going on that point to incredible technical advances.

**To put it simply, we will have a [Nano-Banana](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-08-26-nano-banana)-level open imagegen/imageedit model in a 7B size.** (Per Alibaba’s own Arena rankings on the blogpost)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C5z7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78c41615-a9ec-4a79-9769-b1316e472e1f_2560x1462.png)

Similarly no weights released but lots of hype today is [**Seedance 2.0**](https://petapixel.com/2026/02/09/bytedance-seedance-2-ai-video/), which seems to have solved the Will Smith Spaghetti problem and also generated lots of anime/movie scenes. The sheer flood of examples is almost certainly an astroturfing campaign, but enough people are independently creating new videos that we have some confidence that this isn’t just a cherrypick.

# AI Twitter Recap

**Coding agents, IDE workflows, and “agentic sandboxes” becoming standard plumbing**



- **OpenAI shifts Responses API toward long-running computer work**: OpenAI introduced new primitives aimed at multi-hour agent runs: **server-side compaction** (to avoid context blowups), **OpenAI-hosted containers with networking**, and **Skills** as a first-class API concept (including an initial spreadsheets skill) ([OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2021286050623373500)). In the same window, OpenAI also upgraded **Deep Research** to **GPT‑5.2** and added **connectors** + progress controls ([OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2021299935678026168), [OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2021299936948781095)), reinforcing that “research agents” are productized, not just demos.
- **Sandboxes: “agent in sandbox” vs “sandbox as a tool” becomes a design fault line**: Several posts converge on the same architectural question—should the agent *live inside* an execution environment, or should it *call* an ephemeral sandbox tool? LangChain’s Harrison Chase summarized tradeoffs in a dedicated writeup ([hwchase17](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/2021265779803521245)), with follow-on commentary pushing **sandbox-as-a-tool** as the default for crash tolerance and long-running workflows ([NabbilKhan](https://twitter.com/NabbilKhan/status/2021301427734208856)). LangChain’s **deepagents v0.4** added **pluggable sandbox backends** (Modal/Daytona/Runloop) plus improved summarization/compaction and Responses API defaults ([sydneyrunkle](https://twitter.com/sydneyrunkle/status/2021289479139422296)).
- **Coding agent UX is accelerating, with multi-model orchestration becoming normal**: VS Code and Copilot continue to add agent primitives (worktrees, MCP apps, slash commands) ([JoeCuevasJr](https://twitter.com/JoeCuevasJr/status/2021074196034630103)). One concrete pattern: parallel subagents doing independent review and “grading each other” across **Claude Opus 4.6**, **GPT‑5.3‑Codex**, and **Gemini 3 Pro** ([pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2021094988205969465)). OpenAI’s Codex account paused a rollout of “GPT‑5.3‑Codex” inside @code ([code](https://twitter.com/code/status/2021041639926673503)), while users highlight its token efficiency and app workflow ([reach_vb](https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/2021158781539713109), [gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2021093839315054690), [gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2021272681237361027)).
- **“SDLC after code review” is being reimagined**: A notable funding + product announcement: **EntireHQ** raised a **$60M seed** to build a Git-compatible database that versions not just code but also intent/constraints/reasoning, plus “Checkpoints” to capture agent context (prompts, tool calls, token usage) as commit-adjacent artifacts ([ashtom](https://twitter.com/ashtom/status/2021255786966708280)). This directly targets the emerging pain: teams can generate code quickly, but struggle with provenance, review, coordination, and “what happened” debugging.

**Model releases & modality leaps (image/video/omni) + open-model momentum**



- **Qwen-Image-2.0**: Alibaba Qwen announced **Qwen‑Image‑2.0** with emphasis on **2K native resolution**, **strong text rendering**, and “professional typography” for posters/slides with up to **1K-token prompts**; also positions itself as unified generation + editing with a “lighter architecture” for faster inference ([Alibaba_Qwen](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2021137577311600949)).
- **Seedance 2.0 as the “step change” in text-to-video**: Multiple threads treat ByteDance’s **Seedance 2.0** as a qualitative jump (natural motion, micro-details) and possibly a forcing function for competitors to refresh (Veo/Sora) ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2021176568563785908), [TomLikesRobots](https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/2021347131500667316), [kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2021145731319398887)).
- **Kimi “Agent Swarm” + Kimi K2.5 as agent substrate**: Moonshot’s Kimi shipped an **Agent Swarm** concept: up to **100 sub-agents**, **1500 tool calls**, and claimed **4.5× faster** than sequential execution for parallel research/creation tasks ([Kimi_Moonshot](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2021141949416362381)). Community posts show a workflow pairing **Kimi K2.5 + Seedance 2** to generate large storyboard artifacts (e.g., “100MB Excel storyboard”) feeding video generation ([crystalsssup](https://twitter.com/crystalsssup/status/2021149326290956353)). Baseten highlighted Kimi K2.5 serving performance—**TTFT 0.26s** and **340 TPS** on Artificial Analysis (per their claim) ([basetenco](https://twitter.com/basetenco/status/2021243980802031900)).
- **Open multimodal “sleepers”**: A curated reminder that recent open multimodal releases include **GLM‑OCR**, **MiniCPM‑o‑4.5** (phone-runnable omni), and **InternS1** (science-strong VLM), all described as freely usable commercially ([mervenoyann](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann/status/2021233480957304913)).
- **GLM-4.7-Flash traction**: Zhipu’s **GLM‑4.7‑Flash‑GGUF** became the most downloaded model on Unsloth (per Zhipu) ([Zai_org](https://twitter.com/Zai_org/status/2021207517557051627)).

**Agent coordination & evaluation: from “swarms” to measurable failure modes**

- **Cooperation is still brittle even with real tools (git)**: CooperBench added **git** to paired agents and found only marginal cooperation gains; new failure modes emerged (force-pushes, merge clobbers, inability to reason about partner’s real-time actions). The thesis: infra ≠ social intelligence ([\_Hao_Zhu](https://twitter.com/_Hao_Zhu/status/2021252996848550005)).
- **Dynamic agent creation beats static roles (AOrchestra)**: DAIR summarized **AOrchestra**, where an orchestrator spawns on-demand subagents defined as a 4‑tuple (Instruction/Context/Tools/Model). Reported benchmark gains: **GAIA 80% pass@1** with Gemini‑3‑Flash; **Terminal‑Bench 2.0 52.86%**; **SWE‑Bench‑Verified 82%** ([dair_ai](https://twitter.com/dair_ai/status/2021215864557797608)).
- **Data agents taxonomy**: Another DAIR piece argues “data agents” need clearer levels of autonomy (L0–L5), noting most production systems sit at L1/L2; L4/L5 remain unsolved due to cascading-error risk and dynamic environment adaptation ([dair_ai](https://twitter.com/dair_ai/status/2021252863150924244)).
- **Arena pushes evals closer to enterprise reality (PDFs + funding academia)**: Arena launched **PDF uploads** for model comparisons (document reasoning, extraction, summaries) ([arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2021300537711526113)), and separately announced an **Academic Partnerships Program** funding independent eval research (**up to $50K/project**) ([arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2021268433619374336)). This aligns with ongoing frustration that peer review is too slow relative to model iteration ([kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/2021091566442643753), [gneubig](https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/2021370741237694705)).
- **Anthropic RSP critique on Opus 4.6 thresholding**: A detailed critique argues Anthropic relied too heavily on **internal employee surveys** to decide whether Opus 4.6 crossed a higher-risk R&D autonomy threshold; the complaint is that this is not a responsible substitute for quantitative evals, and follow-ups may bias results ([polynoamial](https://twitter.com/polynoamial/status/2021266471406666231)).

**Training/post-training research themes: RL self-feedback, self-verification, and “concept-level” modeling**



- **iGRPO: RL from the model’s own best draft**: iGRPO wraps GRPO with a two-stage process: sample drafts, pick the highest-reward draft (same scalar reward), then condition on that draft and train to beat it—no critics, no generated critiques. Reported improvements over GRPO across 7B/8B/14B families ([ahatamiz1](https://twitter.com/ahatamiz1/status/2021116982029123874#m), [iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2021160967774634071)).
- **Self-verification as a compute reducer**: “Learning to Self-Verify” is highlighted as improving reasoning while using fewer tokens to solve comparable problems ([iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2021164018132505081)).
- **ConceptLM / next-concept prediction**: A proposal to quantize hidden states into a concept vocabulary and predict concepts instead of next tokens; claims consistent gains and that continual pretraining on an NTP model can further improve it ([iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2021161792110559311)).
- **Scaling laws from language statistics**: Ganguli shared a theory result: predict **data-limited scaling exponents** from properties of natural language (conditional entropy decay vs context length; pairwise token correlation decay vs separation) ([SuryaGanguli](https://twitter.com/SuryaGanguli/status/2021291213639516184)).
- **Architectures leaking via OSS archaeology**: A notable “architecture is out” thread claims **GLM‑5** is ~**740B** with **~50B active**, using **MLA attention** “lifted from DeepSeek V3” plus sparse attention indexing for **200k context** ([QuixiAI](https://twitter.com/QuixiAI/status/2021111352895393960)). Another claims **Qwen3.5** is a hybrid **SSM‑Transformer** with **Gated DeltaNet** linear attention + standard attention, interleaved MRoPE, and shared+routed MoE experts ([QuixiAI](https://twitter.com/QuixiAI/status/2021109801606893837)).

**Inference & systems engineering: faster kernels, cheaper parsing, and vLLM debugging**

- **Unsloth’s MoE training speedup**: Unsloth claims new Triton kernels enable **12× faster** MoE training with **35% less VRAM** and no accuracy loss, plus grouped LoRA matmuls via `torch._grouped_mm` (and fallback to Triton for speed) ([UnslothAI](https://twitter.com/UnslothAI/status/2021244131927023950), [danielhanchen](https://twitter.com/danielhanchen/status/2021250166850977872)).
- **Instruction-level Triton + inline assembly**: A fal performance post teases beating handwritten CUDA kernels by adding small inline elementwise assembly in Triton; the author also notes a custom CUDA kernel using **256-bit global memory loads** (Blackwell) outperforming Triton on smaller shapes ([maharshii](https://twitter.com/maharshii/status/2021241686031008119), [isidentical](https://twitter.com/isidentical/status/2021264421163590085), [maharshii](https://twitter.com/maharshii/status/2021266717641474194)).
- **vLLM in production: throughput tuning + rare failure debugging**: vLLM amplified AI21’s writeups: config tuning + queue-based autoscaling yielded **~2× throughput** for bursty workloads ([vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/2021196826058338321)); a second post dissected a **1-in-1000 gibberish failure** in vLLM + Mamba traced to request classification timing under memory pressure ([vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/2021206931407503868)).
- **Document ingestion cost optimization**: LlamaIndex’s LlamaParse added a “cost optimizer” routing pages to cheaper parsing when text-heavy and to VLM modes for complex layouts, claiming **50–90%** cost savings vs screenshot+VLM baselines, with higher accuracy ([jerryjliu0](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/2021267495123140760)).
- **Local/distributed inference hacks**: An MLX Distributed helper repo reportedly ran **Kimi K‑2.5 (658GB on disk)** across a **4× Mac Studio** cluster over Thunderbolt RDMA, “actually scales” ([digitalix](https://twitter.com/digitalix/status/2021290293715243261)).

**AI-for-science: Isomorphic Labs’ drug design engine as the standout “real-world benchmark win”**



- **IsoDDE claims large gains beyond AlphaFold 3**: Isomorphic Labs posted a technical report claiming a “step-change” in predicting biomolecular structures, **more than doubling AlphaFold 3** on key benchmarks and improving generalization; several posts echo the scale of claimed gains and implications for in‑silico drug design ([IsomorphicLabs](https://twitter.com/IsomorphicLabs/status/2021162400494264517), [maxjaderberg](https://twitter.com/maxjaderberg/status/2021170265242173677), [demishassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/2021223548744822972)). Commentary highlights antibody interface/CDR‑H3 improvements and affinity prediction claims exceeding physics-based methods—while noting limited architectural detail so far ([iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2021172283243413897)).
- **Why it matters (if it holds)**: The strongest framing across the thread cluster is not just “better structures,” but faster discovery loops: identifying cryptic pockets, better affinity estimates, and generalization to novel targets potentially move screening/design upstream of wet labs ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2021217873708917087), [kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2021206410755707307), [demishassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/2021245817105867263)).

- **KOKKI v15.5 Agent-Auditor Loop Debuts**: A member introduced **KOKKI (v15.5)**, an *Agent-Auditor Loop* framework designed to force *"External Reasoning"* and reduce hallucinations in LLMs by splitting the model into a **Drafting Agent** and a **Ruthless Auditor**.
   - The core logic is defined as *Output = Audit(Draft(Input))* and initial experiments with **GPT-4-class models** showed *significant* hallucination reduction.
- **Chain-of-Verification similar to KOKKI**: Another member noted the similarity of the *draft→critic loops* in **KOKKI** to existing work like **Chain-of-Verification** and **Self-Refine / Reflexion-style refinement loops**, asking for benchmark and metric results.
   - The original poster clarified that **KOKKI** was born from real-world frustration with hallucinations rather than benchmark optimization, with qualitative evaluations showing a reduction in fabricated details and more frequent "I don't know" responses.
- **Cross-Model Auditing improves Reliability**: A member found that running **KOKKI** as a *cross-model audit setup* (e.g., **ChatGPT** drafting + **Claude/Kiro** auditing) improved both reliability and time-to-correction compared to a single-model loop.
   - The poster emphasized that **KOKKI** externalizes the missing logic of *self-audit* and *internal accountability* in current LLMs in an explicit and enforceable manner.

> `CPU LLaMA bounty challenges, Tinygrad changes for bounty, RK3588 NPU backend bounty` 


- **CPU LLaMA Bounty Proves Difficult**: A member shared that the CPU LLaMA bounty was difficult due to issues with *loop ordering, memory access patterns, and devectorization* and that heuristics alone didn't yield good **SIMD** and clean instructions.
- **Tips for Claiming Tinygrad Bounty**: George Hotz strongly encouraged changes to **Tinygrad** to be upstreamed to claim the bounty, suggesting techniques like *better sort, better dtype unpacking, better fusion, and contiguous memory arrangement*.
   - He noted that while a large number of **hand-coded kernels** would not be upstreamed, something similar to his work for embedded systems might be.
- **RK3588 NPU Backend Bounty Still Open**: A member expressed interest in the **RK3588 NPU backend bounty**, noting extensive tracing of Rockchip's model compiler/converter and runtime but struggling with a clean Tinygrad integration.
   - He suggested one path might be to *turn rangeified + tiled UOps back up into matmuls and convolutions*.
- **George Hotz suggests implementing a slow RK3588 backend**: George Hotz suggested implementing a **slow backend first** without matmul acceleration and subclassing `ops_dsp.py` as an example, but letting things fall through to the default behavior.
- **PR Review Times are Proportional**: The time to review a **PR** is *proportional to the PR size and inversely proportional to the value of the PR*.

# AI Twitter Recap

**Google’s Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image Preview) and the new image-eval meta**



- **Nano Banana 2 launch + rollout footprint**: Google and DeepMind shipped **Nano Banana 2** (aka **Gemini 3.1 Flash Image Preview**) as a “Flash-tier” image generation/editing model rolling out across **Gemini App, Search (AI Mode/Lens), Flow, Google Ads**, and in preview via **AI Studio / Gemini API / Vertex AI** ([Google](https://x.com/Google/status/2027051657163391104), [GoogleDeepMind](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2027051577899380991), [GeminiApp](https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2027052041697464629), [sundarpichai](https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/2027057726170509724), [demishassabis](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/2027063584094605732)). Product claims emphasize **world knowledge**, **improved i18n text rendering**, **aspect ratio control**, **upscaling up to 4K**, and **multi-subject consistency** (e.g., “up to **5 characters & 14 objects**”) ([Google](https://x.com/Google/status/2027051660392944035), [joshwoodward](https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/2027055559162450254)).
- **Arena/Artificial Analysis results + pricing signal**: Multiple evaluators report Nano Banana 2 taking **#1 Text-to-Image** and strong editing placements, while undercutting “Pro” pricing—e.g., **$67 / 1k images** cited by Artificial Analysis vs ~$133–134 for GPT Image 1.5 and Nano Banana Pro ([ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2027052241019175148), [arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2027053222876393703), [kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2027048109801419015)). Arena added **image subcategories** and highlighted largest gains in **text rendering** and **3D imaging/modeling** ([arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2027152296547930153)). This is also a reminder that **leaderboards are becoming product levers**: “day-0” integrations (e.g., [fal](https://x.com/fal/status/2027058299095351479)) and prompt packs/templates ship alongside eval wins ([GeminiApp templates](https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2027081255804870985), [GoogleAI prompts](https://x.com/GoogleAI/status/2027094912357761319)).
- **Real-time search-conditioned generation**: Google repeatedly frames NB2 as powered by **real-time information and images from web search** (not just static pretraining), positioning it as “more accurate views from any window in the world” style demos ([sundarpichai](https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/2027057726170509724)).
- **Downstream availability**: Nano Banana 2 quickly appeared in third-party products, including **Perplexity Computer** ([AravSrinivas](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2027149820138533241)).

**Agentic coding + productized “tasks”, memory, and evals (and the backlash against complexity)**



- **Agents “just work” more often now, but still fail off-distribution**: Several practitioners describe a step change in reliability/utility for coding agents across recent frontier models (e.g., GPT-5.2 / GPT-5.3 Codex, Opus 4.6, Gemini 3.1), shifting from “proof of concept” to something like delegating CLI work to juniors ([teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2026980249599168972), [paul_cal](https://x.com/paul_cal/status/2027000070109909441)). Others caution that advanced ML/data engineering remains brittle off-distribution ([michalwols](https://x.com/michalwols/status/2027031882974613836), [MParakhin](https://x.com/MParakhin/status/2027027034828902421)).
- **“Tasks” as the new packaging layer**: Microsoft’s **Copilot Tasks** pitches “talk less, do more” delegation with user-visible plans and control, in “research preview” ([mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2027111503003107377), [yusuf_i_mehdi](https://x.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/2027111916272001401)).
- **Persistent memory becomes table stakes—and introduces interoperability pain**: A widely shared update claims Claude rolled out **auto-memory** (“remembers what it learns across sessions”) ([trq212](https://x.com/trq212/status/2027109375765356723)), echoed in the Claude ecosystem ([omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2027117473229676864)). Developers immediately hit workflow friction when memory/state lives in tool-specific hidden directories (hurting “multi-agent, multi-tool” continuity) ([borisdayma](https://x.com/borisdayma/status/2027087042375553059)).
- **Tooling ships fast: PR bug-fixing bots, code↔design loops, and editor-level improvements**:
  - **Cursor Bugbot Autofix** automates fixing issues found in PRs ([cursor_ai](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2027079876948484200), [aye_aye_kaplan](https://x.com/aye_aye_kaplan/status/2027080562004152818)).
  - OpenAI’s **Codex “code → design → code”** roundtrip with Figma aims to make UI iteration less lossy ([OpenAIDevs](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2027062351724527723), [figma](https://x.com/figma/status/2027068943702364250)).
  - VS Code’s **long-distance Next Edit Suggestions** focuses on predicting *where not to edit* and supporting “flow” ([code](https://x.com/code/status/2027093279762747526), [pierceboggan](https://x.com/pierceboggan/status/2027107798061044219), [alexdima123](https://x.com/alexdima123/status/2027163071551078845)).
- **Eval inflation + benchmark gaming concerns**: Threads call out that high leaderboard scores can mask **token-inefficient reasoning** and failures on “bullshit tests” (e.g., repeated-token “strawberry” variants), warning against over-trusting HLE/GPQA-style metrics without cost accounting ([scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2027110908775002312)). Arena responds by adding more granular test regimes like **Multi-File React** for code models ([arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2027114744847720782)).
- **Complexity is the real tax**: A recurring engineering concern is that “10k LOC/day” bragging creates long-term **complexity debt**—agents make it easier to ship, not easier to maintain ([Yuchenj_UW](https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/2027082979890368597)). Another angle: coding agents can create **implicit lock-in** if they “sloppify” your codebase such that working without them becomes painful ([typedfemale](https://x.com/typedfemale/status/2027187838123647338)).

**Perplexity’s distribution + retrieval stack: Samsung integration and new embedding models**



- **Samsung S26 system-level Perplexity (“Hey Plex”)**: Perplexity says every Galaxy S26 will ship with Perplexity built in, including a wake word and deep OS integration; **Bixby routes web/research/generative queries to Perplexity** while handling on-device actions ([perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2027067776217841792), [perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2027067800825872454), [AravSrinivas](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2027068958541799749)). This is framed as part of a broader partnership that also targets **Samsung Internet** and optional default search positioning ([perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2027067812494364902)).
- **pplx-embed / pplx-embed-context released (MIT)**: Perplexity launched two embedding model families at **0.6B and 4B**, including a “context” variant intended for doc chunk embeddings in RAG; both are **MIT licensed** and available via HF + Perplexity API, with a paper (arXiv:2602.11151) ([perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2027094981161410710), [perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2027095040120733703), [alvarobartt](https://x.com/alvarobartt/status/2027094524699259162)). They also disclose internal benchmarks like **PPLXQuery2Query / PPLXQuery2Doc** with **115k real queries** over **30M docs** from **1B+ pages** ([perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2027095027881750923)). Arav claims the embedding models are “industry leading” ([AravSrinivas](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/2027096219198394614)).
- **Strategic read**: The pair of moves—OS distribution + retrieval primitives—suggests Perplexity is trying to own both **front door** (assistant entry point) and **core search stack** (embeddings + evals), rather than depending on third-party platforms.

**Inference, kernels, and infra: MoE support, heterogeneous hardware, and KV movement**

- **MoE becomes “first-class” in 🤗 Transformers**: Hugging Face shipped deeper MoE plumbing (loading, expert backends, expert parallelism, hub support) and highlights collaboration on faster MoE training (including with Unsloth) ([ariG23498](https://x.com/ariG23498/status/2026995823536751072), [mervenoyann](https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/2026999892099354853)).
- **DeepSeek and multi-hardware inference seriousness**: Early in the batch, DeepSeek is called out as “serious about inference support on diverse hardware” ([teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2026976510360322534)). Separately, a DeepSeek DualPath detail describes staging **KV cache** in **decode-server DRAM** then moving it to prefill GPUs via **GDRDMA** to avoid local PCIe bottlenecks ([JordanNanos](https://x.com/JordanNanos/status/2027126010576298469)). This reflects a broader shift: inference is increasingly a **systems architecture problem**, not just kernel-level optimization.
- **Kernel coverage and GPU generations**: vikhyatk describes building inference kernels across NVIDIA architectures (sm80→sm110) and notes edge-device ISA issues like Orin CPU lacking SVE ([vikhyatk](https://x.com/vikhyatk/status/2027002892083986624), [vikhyatk](https://x.com/vikhyatk/status/2027017720466985437)).
- **Quantization isn’t uniformly safe**: Evaluations show **MiniMax M2.5 GGUF quantizations** degrade much more than expected vs Qwen3.5, arguing “just take Q4” doesn’t generalize across model families ([bnjmn_marie](https://x.com/bnjmn_marie/status/2027043753484021810)).

**World models, agents in simulators, and “multiplayer” environments**

- **Solaris: multiplayer Minecraft world modeling stack**: A major research drop proposes that world modeling should focus on **shared global state** rather than pixel rendering, releasing (1) a **multiplayer data collection engine**, (2) a **multiplayer DiT** with a “memory efficient self forcing design” trained on **12.6M frames**, and (3) a **VLM-judge evaluation suite** for multi-agent consistency ([sainingxie](https://x.com/sainingxie/status/2027115356318474661), [georgysavva](https://x.com/georgysavva/status/2027119472096518358)). The pitch: multi-agent capability requires a shared representation beneath individual views.
- **LLMs as embodied controllers (toy but telling)**: A CARLA→OpenEnv port shows a small **Qwen 0.6B** learning to brake/swerve to avoid pedestrians in **~50 steps** using TRL + HF Spaces ([SergioPaniego](https://x.com/SergioPaniego/status/2027064485056241971)). This exemplifies a trend toward “LLM+env” loops where reversibility is limited and mistakes persist.

**Governance flashpoint: Anthropic vs the Pentagon on surveillance and autonomous weapons**



- **Pentagon pressure campaign reported, then Anthropic responds publicly**: A widely shared claim says the DoD issued a “final offer” to Anthropic, including threats to label it a “supply chain risk” and demands for unrestricted military use ([KobeissiLetter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/2027031529042411581)). Anthropic then published a CEO statement drawing explicit red lines: **no mass domestic surveillance** and **no fully autonomous weapons** (given current reliability), also alleging threats involving the **Defense Production Act** ([AnthropicAI](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2027150818575528261)). A widely quoted excerpt is reposted with detail ([AndrewCurran_](https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/2027153267285962991)).
- **Industry reaction + solidarity mechanics**: The stance triggered strong support from prominent researchers/engineers, framing it as values-under-pressure rather than “policy theater” ([fchollet](https://x.com/fchollet/status/2027195535594049641), [TrentonBricken](https://x.com/TrentonBricken/status/2027156295745479086), [awnihannun](https://x.com/awnihannun/status/2027172428364107826)). A petition aiming to coordinate “shared understanding” reportedly gathered signatures from OpenAI/Google staff ([jasminewsun](https://x.com/jasminewsun/status/2027197574017602016), [sammcallister](https://x.com/sammcallister/status/2027183090020311357), [maxsloef](https://x.com/maxsloef/status/2027170763447710085)). This is notable as an explicit attempt to prevent a race-to-the-bottom dynamic via transparency about where each lab stands.
- **Why this matters technically**: The core dispute is about **capability vs. reliability** and “lawful use” language being misaligned with what frontier models can safely do today. Reliability concerns show up elsewhere in the dataset too (e.g., minimal security test cases where models leak confidential info even when instructed not to) ([jonasgeiping](https://x.com/jonasgeiping/status/2026991819607699475), [random_walker](https://x.com/random_walker/status/2027012231636848794)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Qwen3.5 Model Performance and Comparisons

  - **[Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Q4 Quantization Comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rfds1h/qwen3535ba3b_q4_quantization_comparison/)** (Activity: 635): **The post presents a detailed comparison of Q4 quantization methods for the Qwen3.5-35B-A3B model, focusing on their faithfulness to the BF16 baseline using metrics like **KL Divergence (KLD)** and **Perplexity (PPL)**. The analysis highlights that **AesSedai's Q4_K_M** achieves the lowest KLD of `0.0102`, indicating high faithfulness, while **Ubergarm's Q4_0** significantly outperforms other Q4_0 quantizations. The post also notes that **MXFP4** is less effective when applied post-hoc compared to during Quantization Aware Training (QAT). The efficiency score, which balances model size and KLD, ranks **AesSedai_Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-IQ4_XS** as the most efficient quantization. The setup used for testing includes an Intel Core i3-12100F CPU, 64 GB RAM, and an RTX 3060 GPU, with results based on the `wikitext2_test.txt` dataset.** Commenters appreciate the detailed comparison and suggest that quantizers should include such analyses in their documentation. There is also a discussion about the potential bias in using wikitext for PPL/KLD measurements, as it might be included in some imatrix datasets, suggesting the use of a fresh dataset for more accurate comparisons.



    - The comment by 'ps5cfw' highlights the ambiguity in quantization terminology like 'Q4_K_M', emphasizing the need for standardization and clarity in documentation. This is crucial for making meaningful comparisons between different quantization methods, especially after issues like the XL debacle.
    - 'noneabove1182' points out a potential issue with using wikitext as a PPL/KLD measurement, as some datasets might include wikitext, potentially skewing results. They suggest using a fresh dataset, such as STT from a recent podcast, for more accurate comparisons. This highlights the importance of dataset transparency and selection in benchmarking.
    - 'danielhanchen' discusses ongoing investigations into the high perplexity of Q4_K_XL due to MXFP4 layers. They note that other quantizations like Q2_K_XL and Q3_K_XL are unaffected. The comment also mentions that the UD-Q4-K-XL quantization significantly outperforms Q4-K-M in real-world benchmarks, as shown in Benjamin Marie’s LiveCodeBench v5.

  - **[Qwen3.5 122B in 72GB VRAM (3x3090) is the best model available at this time — also it nails the “car wash test”](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rf2ulo/qwen35_122b_in_72gb_vram_3x3090_is_the_best_model/)** (Activity: 706): **The post discusses the performance of the **Qwen3.5 122B** model, which is optimized to run on a setup with `72GB VRAM` using three `3090 GPUs`. The user highlights its efficiency, achieving `25 tokens per second` with specific settings like `Temperature 0.6`, `K Sampling 20`, and `Top P sampling 0.8`. The model is noted for its ability to handle a `120k context` in Q3 mode, despite being slower than other models like GLM Air and GPT-OSS-120B. The user also mentions challenges with other configurations like MXFP4 and IQ4_XS, which require offloading layers to RAM, reducing speed to `6-8 tok/s`.** One commenter notes achieving `34-36 tok/sec` with a different setup, using **Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-UD-Q4_K_XL** and a Ryzen 9 9950X3D with RTX 5090. Another comment critiques the 'car wash test' as a biased scenario that exploits model training biases, suggesting it is not a definitive measure of model intelligence.

    - A user reports achieving **34-36 tokens per second** with the `Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-UD-Q4_K_XL` model and **16-18 tokens per second** with the `Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-UD-Q8_K_XL` model, both at a maximum context size of 256K. Their setup includes a Ryzen 9 9950X3D, RTX 5090, and 128 GB DDR5 5600 RAM, running on Cachy OS Linux, which is based on Arch Linux.
    - The 'car wash test' is critiqued as being less meaningful than often suggested. It is described as a scenario that frequently appears in training data, which biases the model to replicate learned logic rather than demonstrating genuine reasoning ability. This test is seen as a targeted probe of a specific model weakness rather than a comprehensive measure of intelligence.
    - There are reports of issues with the 4-bit Unsloth quantization in the Qwen3.5 model series, suggesting potential for further optimization. Despite these issues, the model is noted for its impressive performance, especially in contrast to previous releases that did not meet expectations.

  - **[Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B creates FlappyBird](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ret353/qwenqwen3535ba3b_creates_flappybird/)** (Activity: 372): **The post discusses the use of the **Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B** model to create a Flappy Bird clone using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, initialized with Vite. The model, hosted locally, demonstrated effective coding capabilities by generating a basic game structure and implementing features like music using the Web Audio API, a scrollable parallax background, and a flock of birds. The user noted some initial visual glitches with the parallax effect, which were resolved with minor adjustments, and successfully added a sound settings panel in a single attempt.** One commenter suggested the potential for open model companies to conduct repeated benchmarks or tests with different games to evaluate performance, indicating interest in further exploration of the model's capabilities.

    - BitXorBit raises an interesting point about the potential for open model companies to prepare for repeated benchmarks or tests. They suggest trying different games and sharing results, which could provide insights into the model's adaptability and performance across various tasks. This could be particularly relevant for evaluating the generalization capabilities of models like Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B.

   - It emerged from **diffusion research** moreso than normalizing flows though.
- **Bezier Flow Learning Needs Improvements**: Some members wondered about the [Bezier flow paper](https://fxtwitter.com/_emliu/status/2026359480363913531), noting that it appears to require **5 epochs on ImageNet** to learn only **32 parameters**.
   - The sentiment was that distillation approaches still offer better generation quality at convergence.
- **Shortcut Distillation Speed Compared**: A member inquired whether **shortcut distillation** (finetuning a pretrained diffusion model via a shortcut-like objective) converges more quickly than **consistency distillation**.
   - The intuition behind this question is that the function outputs targeted with shortcut distillation are *"closer"* to those from the pretrained velocity field compared to consistency distillation.
- **Exploring LLMs With Multiple Inputs/Outputs**: A member asked if there are any papers pretraining **LLMs that have multiple inputs and multiple outputs**, such as processing a batch of inputs with a single model.
   - One suggestion involved a paper from a year ago where they inputted 4 subsequent tokens at once by adding embeddings, which sped up training.
- **Deleting Neurons: A Novel Approach**: A paper was mentioned discussing the deletion of neurons that are either all positive or all negative across an entire dataset ([IEEE paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.ieee.org/abstract/document/11087585)).
   - One member found this interesting, noting they had not considered that a neuron which is always active could be deleted due to being ~linear, sparking an idea for an optimizer that uses **activation momentum** to encourage diverse activation patterns.

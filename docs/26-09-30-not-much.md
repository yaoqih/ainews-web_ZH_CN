  - **Scale**: OpenAI recorded 16,000 attempts from more than 4,000 users in two days, with related activity across more than 15,000 users.
  - **External researchers**: Their attacks kept working on Astra until this week. Patches were hard to propagate across product versions and third-party hosts ([@JSchaeff3r](https://x.com/JSchaeff3r/status/2105356987630543057), [@jonasgeiping](https://x.com/jonasgeiping/status/2105381603237368304)).
  - **Criticism**: Nathan Lambert argues the vulnerability is the API provider's responsibility ([@natolambert](https://x.com/natolambert/status/2105351603444420995)).
- **Distillation defenses**: Defenses evaluated without later RL give a false sense of security. RL makes simple attacks effective ([@shidan_javaheri](https://x.com/shidan_javaheri/status/2105349479868281201)).
- **Embedded evaluations**: Apollo Research published principles for outside evaluators who receive employee-like access to frontier labs ([@ApolloResearch](https://x.com/ApolloResearch/status/2105330306266153454)).
- **Cyber evals**: On CyberGym-E2E-AA, some frontier models are safety-blocked on more than 85% of tasks ([@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2105465206189195378)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap



### 1. GLM-5.3 Cyber Risk and Local Inference Support

  - **[GLM-5.3 and the Spread of Advanced Cyber Capabilities \ Anthropic](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wtg0vd/glm53_and_the_spread_of_advanced_cyber/)** (Activity: 785): ****Anthropic** reports that Zhipu/Z.ai’s open-weight **[GLM-5.3](https://www.anthropic.com/research/glm-5-3-and-the-spread-of-advanced-cyber-capabilities)** crosses a notable threshold for autonomous cyber capability: `50/410` end-to-end **V8** exploits on ExploitBench, close to Claude Mythos Preview’s `56/410`, plus full control-flow hijacks on `4%` of Anthropic’s internal binary exploitation tasks where prior models were near zero. Anthropic frames the risk as *capability + accessibility*: GLM-5.3 is widely downloadable, relatively cheap, and weakly refusal-tuned, with simple jailbreaks reportedly succeeding `64–100%` of the time and “abliteration” dropping refusals to low single digits with little measured capability degradation.** Top comments were largely hostile to Anthropic’s framing, arguing the post reads as an attempt to suppress a cheaper/open Chinese model near Anthropic’s frontier. One commenter emphasized legitimate defensive use, saying GLM-5.3 is their only practical tool for security testing and improving their own software.

    - Commenters highlight **GLM-5.3** as a low-cost, less-restricted model perceived to be close to frontier capability, with one user framing it as useful for *“security testing and improvements on my own software”* rather than inherently malicious. The technical concern raised is that restrictions by providers like **Anthropic** could limit defensive cybersecurity workflows that require models willing to analyze potentially sensitive exploit or vulnerability patterns.
    - One commenter references prior **GLM-5.2** models as having helped mitigate a **Hugging Face attack**, contrasting that with **Claude** allegedly refusing assistance. The substantive point is that refusal policies may reduce utility in incident response or vulnerability remediation scenarios, while more permissive models can be operationally useful for defensive security tasks.

  - **[add GLM-5.3-Flash (GLM5-Next) support by timkhronos · Pull Request #27773 · ggml-org/llama.cpp](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wu0bdf/add_glm53flash_glm5next_support_by_timkhronos/)** (Activity: 348): **Merged [`ggml-org/llama.cpp#27773`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/27773) adds **GLM-5.3-Flash / GLM5-Next** support to `llama.cpp`, enabling local inference for the **320B hybrid text+vision** model. The implementation adds GLM-specific DSA indexing/pooling, hybrid indexed memory, and a new `glm5v` vision preprocessing/tower path, while reusing Kimi-K3 KDA layers, DeepSeek-style MoE/mHC helpers, MLA-only attention, and DSV4-style SwigLU clamping; validation reports random-model logits matching Transformers across prefill/ubatching/decode and vision embedding agreement around `1e-5`, with some precision-sensitive tensors left unquantized.** Commenters were concerned that `llama.cpp` model support is lagging behind the pace of new experimental architectures, with one noting the effective bottleneck appears to be maintainer availability. A technical compatibility issue was also raised: existing Unsloth quantizations reportedly use `glm5next` while mainline expects `glm5-next`, so current mainline may fail to load those quants.

    - Commenters noted a compatibility issue between the **Unsloth** quantization PR and the mainline `llama.cpp` PR: one identifies the architecture/model type as `glm5next` while the other uses `glm5-next`, meaning mainline `llama.cpp` may fail to load existing Unsloth GLM-5.3-Flash quants without conversion or metadata fixes.
    - There was concern that `llama.cpp` support is lagging behind the pace of new model releases, especially as newer models increasingly use experimental architectures that require bespoke loader/runtime changes before inference and optimization work can land. One commenter framed GLM-5.3-Flash support as taking roughly *“another month”* after model release, with progress depending heavily on a small number of maintainers.




### 2. Local AI Acceleration: WebGPU Kernels and EPYC Bandwidth

  - **[We just open-sourced the world's fastest WebGPU kernels for local AI on Hugging Face](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wu8tpg/we_just_opensourced_the_worlds_fastest_webgpu/)** (Activity: 459): ****Hugging Face** announced an open-source collection of WebGPU kernels covering `200+` common ML ops, intended to run **fully locally in the browser** via the client GPU rather than cloud inference. The kernels are listed on [huggingface.co/kernels?platform=webgpu](https://huggingface.co/kernels?platform=webgpu), with implementation/benchmark context in the [Hugging Face WebGPU kernels blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/webgpu-kernels), and the team says they are working to upstream optimizations into **Transformers.js**, **ONNX Runtime Web**, **LiteRT.js**, and related runtimes.** Comment discussion centered on what WebGPU actually means—i.e., browser-accessible local GPU compute through a web API—and speculation that optimized browser inference could enable real-time local AI in web apps, such as loading ~`0.8GB` models for co-op game agents.

    - One commenter focused on the practical target enabled by fast WebGPU kernels: browser apps loading roughly a `0.8GB` local decision model and running inference in real time, e.g. for co-op gaming with an on-device AI agent. The implied technical concern is whether WebGPU inference can meet latency and memory constraints for interactive workloads without server-side execution.
    - A technically relevant question asked for clarification of **WebGPU’s execution model**: whether computation runs on the user’s local GPU or in the cloud, and what the “Web” part means. The core distinction raised is that WebGPU is a browser API exposing local GPU compute/graphics capabilities to web apps, rather than a cloud GPU service.

  - **[AMD's new 256 core  EPYC has 16-channel DDR5-12800, 91% memory bandwidth of an RTX 5090](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wtc4j9/amds_new_256_core_epyc_has_16channel_ddr512800_91/)** (Activity: 1554): **A linked [Tom’s Hardware report](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-drops-an-epyc-usd15-000-256-core-bomb-epyc-9006-zen-6-venice-cpus-get-full-spec-and-pricing-treatment-from-usd700-up-to-usd14-904) says **AMD EPYC 9006 “Venice” / Zen 6** SKUs range from roughly **`$700` to `$14,904`**, with a **`256-core`** flagship near `$15k`. The Reddit title highlights the platform’s alleged **`16-channel DDR5-12800`** memory subsystem and frames its aggregate bandwidth as **~`91%` of an RTX 5090**, implying unusually high CPU-side memory bandwidth for large-model inference workloads—though the linked summary does not expose the full SKU/spec table needed to verify clocks, TDP, cache, or exact bandwidth math.** The comments were mostly non-technical jokes and cost anxiety: users joked this belongs in “RichPeopleofLocalLLaMA” and predicted server-memory prices could spike again. No substantive benchmarking or architecture debate appeared in the top comments.





### 3. ChatGPT Pro Compute Limits Tighten

  - **[Looks like the era of subsidised compute is coming to an end. The old ChatGPT Pro $200 20x plan will be halved. The new $500 plan will have similar limits as the (old) $200 plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wt5f4e/looks_like_the_era_of_subsidised_compute_is/)** (Activity: 2385): **The image is a screenshot of an X post claiming **OpenAI’s ChatGPT Pro `$200/month` plan** is reopening but with a revised usage calculation that effectively cuts the included compute/API-equivalent value to roughly **half** of the previous Pro plan. The post frames this as the end of “subsidised compute,” with a new **`$500/month` tier** allegedly offering limits comparable to the old `$200` plan; see the image [here](https://i.redd.it/zgrwz1cyffsh1.png).** Commenters interpret the change as evidence that access to high-end AI will become increasingly stratified by income, with some predicting `$1k–$2k` subscriptions and others arguing users should refuse to pay if pricing becomes unreasonable.


  - **[Deepseek Harness app is out now!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1wtg1hs/deepseek_harness_app_is_out_now/)** (Activity: 468): ****DeepSeek Harness** is now available in public preview as an **MIT-licensed, open-source agent harness** built on Cordis’s plugin architecture, with desktop downloads and a Web UI via `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` ([DeepSeek Harness](https://www.deepseek.com/en/harness/)). It supports composable plugins for productivity/coding/research workflows, including scheduled tasks, voice input, terminals, subagents, agent teams, and plugin generation, plus developer observability such as execution traces, tool-call timelines, and runtime details.** Top comments focus on platform/support gaps and packaging questions: the desktop app appears to be **Windows/macOS only** with no Linux build mentioned, and users ask whether this is distinct from the earlier v4-era release and whether a **TUI** exists.

    - Users noted **Deepseek Harness currently ships only for Windows/macOS with no Linux support**, which is a significant limitation for local-model workflows where Linux is commonly used for GPU inference and server deployment.
    - One technical user described Harness as a useful but still **preview-quality** tool: plugin breakage and backward-compatibility issues are frequent, comparable to early `opencode`. They warned extension developers to run compatibility checks after every update, reportedly every `3–4 days`, because plugins may break across releases.

### 1. Gemini 4 Argon Launch Benchmarks

  - **[Gemini 4 Argon: our next era of frontier intelligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1wufgo3/gemini_4_argon_our_next_era_of_frontier/)** (Activity: 1422): ****Google** announced [**Gemini 4 Argon**](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-4-argon/), a frontier model initially restricted to trusted cyber defenders via the **Fairwind Program**, with planned pricing of **`$2/M` input tokens**, **`$10/M` output tokens**, and **`95%` discounted cached inputs**. It targets long-horizon SWE, enterprise/multimodal workflows, and defensive cybersecurity, raising output capacity to **`1M` tokens** and reporting benchmark scores including **`77.9%` DeepSWE v1.1**, **`51.3%` AutomationBench**, **`91.7%` LVBench**, and **`68%` CWE-bench v1**. Broad availability is gated on safety work around cyber/CBRN misuse, prompt injection, misalignment monitoring, and hardened agent sandboxes.** Commenters focused on the lack of public or Google AI Pro access, asking whether any lower-tier models will be released. One technical commenter argued **DeepSWE is saturated**, so the headline score is less informative, while “trading blows with Astra on Terminal Bench 4” may be the more meaningful signal.

    - One commenter argues that **DeepSWE** may be a saturated benchmark, so Gemini 4 Argon reaching an all-time high there is less informative; they view performance “trading blows with **Astra** on **Terminal Bench 4**” as a potentially more meaningful signal of real capability.
    - A technical detail called out is the reported increase in maximum output length from `64k` tokens to `1M` tokens, which would be a major jump for long-form generation, agent traces, code output, and extended reasoning workflows if generally available.



  - **[Gemini 4 for real](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1wufb0a/gemini_4_for_real/)** (Activity: 1513): **The [image](https://i.redd.it/n73dxu62spsh1.jpeg) is a benchmark-style comparison table titled **“Gemini 4 for real”**, claiming a **“Gemini 4 Argon”** model outperforms hypothetical/future competitors like **“GPT-6 Astra,” “Claude Fable 5.1,”** and **“Claude Opus 5.5”** across knowledge work, agentic coding, science/math, long context, computer use, multimodal understanding, and cybersecurity. Given the unreal model names and lack of verifiable methodology beyond a referenced DeepMind eval link, this should be treated as a **non-technical meme/rumor image rather than a credible benchmark release**.** Comments are mostly hype and speculation, including a claim that a “Polymarket guy” may have had insider information, but there is no substantive technical discussion.

    - A commenter quoted an apparent announcement for **Gemini 4 Argon**, describing it as a “frontier model” being rolled out first to trusted cyber defenders via a **Fairwind Program**. The quoted text claims Argon is designed for *“deep reasoning across complex, long-horizon workflows”* with target domains including real-world software engineering, enterprise legal/finance knowledge work, and cybersecurity defense, and notes a phased release involving U.S. government voluntary pre-release access and guardrail iteration before broader developer/enterprise/consumer availability.

  - **[Gemini 4 from straight from the horses mouth](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1wufaxm/gemini_4_from_straight_from_the_horses_mouth/)** (Activity: 1356): **The post appears to point to a Google-origin screenshot/image implying **Gemini 4** activity/confirmation, framed as “Google’s back,” but no concrete specs, benchmark numbers, release date, or model-card details are provided in the text. A top comment contrasts the hype with **SemiAnalysis**’ August claim that Google’s “odds of reaching SOTA again have dropped to zero” in [*Gemini Is Cooked, But GCP Is Cooking*](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/gemini-is-cooked-but-gcp-is-cooking), while another notes Gemini’s practical differentiator: native **video and audio input-context** handling in addition to text/image multimodality.** Commenters are cautiously optimistic but want real-world validation, explicitly warning that any apparent gains may be “benchmaxxed.” There is also interest in whether agentic LLMs like Gemini can produce high-quality prose, not just score well on technical benchmarks.

    - A technically relevant concern is that the rumored **Gemini 4** needs validation under real workloads rather than headline benchmarks; one commenter warned it may be “benchmaxxed,” implying benchmark overfitting or selective evaluation could inflate perceived capability.
    - Commenters highlighted Gemini’s differentiated **native multimodal context** support, specifically the ability to process **video and audio inputs** in addition to text/image, which remains a practical advantage for agentic workflows requiring rich media understanding.
    - One thread contrasted current optimism with [SemiAnalysis’ August claim](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/gemini-is-cooked-but-gcp-is-cooking) that Google’s odds of reaching SOTA had “dropped to zero,” with commenters pointing to Google’s structural advantages: very large compute budgets, proprietary data access, and deep transformer-era research experience.




### 2. OpenAI Dots Agents and Pro 500 Pricing

  - **[OpenAI launches dots (long-running agents)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1wtfsn4/openai_launches_dots_longrunning_agents/)** (Activity: 1822): **The image ([link](https://i.redd.it/khxdrys1rhsh1.png)) appears to show an OpenAI stage presentation announcing **“dots”**, described by the post title as **long-running agents**. No implementation details, API surface, model architecture, benchmarks, reliability metrics, or task-duration limits are provided in the title, image, or comments, so the technical significance is limited to a launch/branding reveal rather than a substantive engineering disclosure.** Commenters mostly reacted to the event hype and timing of the post, with one criticizing the audience reaction as performative because people did not yet know what “dots” was.

    - A commenter questioned the technical distinction between **OpenAI “dots” / long-running agents** and existing **Codex-style goal/task execution**, using Sam Altman’s example of *“migrate a legacy API”* as a case that appears functionally similar to assigning a coding agent a task rather than a clearly new capability.

  - **[OpenAI just launched a $500/month plan and cut the $200 Pro in half. What the actual fuck.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1wthna3/openai_just_launched_a_500month_plan_and_cut_the/)** (Activity: 1780): **Reddit post claims **OpenAI introduced a `$500/month` “Pro 500” tier** while reducing usage limits on the existing **`$200/month` Pro plan by ~50%**, positioning the new tier as the option for higher-throughput/“Ultrafast” usage in Codex/Astra-style token generation. The stated pricing ladder is `$20` Plus, `$200` Pro with reduced quota, and `$500` Pro 500 for substantially higher speed/usage.** Commenters view the change as a hostile pricing/packaging move, especially for `$200/month` users, and note poor timing due to reported service issues. Some say they will switch to Claude or lower-cost Chinese AI alternatives rather than pay `$500/month` for what they characterize as the former higher-usage tier.

    - Users calculated that the effective quota/price ratio for higher-tier usage worsened sharply: one business user claimed their previous setup was `$400/month` for `40x` usage, while the new plan is `$500/month` for `25x`, implying a major increase in cost per unit of allowance with no obvious service or model-capability improvement. The same commenter questioned whether “ultrafast” access simply burns quota faster rather than providing meaningful added value.
    - Several commenters framed the change as a migration trigger toward alternatives such as **Claude** and “China AI” providers, specifically because the perceived value of OpenAI’s `20x` tier at `$500/month` no longer compares favorably to competing model subscriptions. One user also noted poor timing because OpenAI services were reportedly experiencing availability issues during the pricing change rollout.




### 3. Claude 5.5 Performance and Cost Analysis

  - **[Is Opus 5.5 entering a “nerfed” phase? LiveNerf baseline update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1wtlrnu/is_opus_55_entering_a_nerfed_phase_livenerf/)** (Activity: 3173): **The image is a **technical chart** from the LiveNerf project showing **Claude Opus 5.5 daily accuracy vs. its own launch-week baseline** on a frozen `78`-question panel with `95%` confidence intervals: scores fluctuate around ~`58–64%`, then the latest point drops to `52.6%` on day `6/10` of baseline collection. The author stresses this is **not yet evidence of a nerf**; the baseline is still being established until day `10`, and any statistically supported degradation claim would require data through around day `20`. Image: [i.redd.it/3w70f2x9vish1.jpeg](https://i.redd.it/3w70f2x9vish1.jpeg), repo: [ninjahawk/livenerf](https://github.com/ninjahawk/livenerf).** Comments are mostly anxious anecdotal reactions rather than technical critique, with users saying the dip matches recent “wait what?” moments using Opus 5.5. No substantive methodological debate appears in the provided top comments.

    - Multiple users report anecdotal quality regressions in **Opus 5.5** after a short outage, describing first-time “wait what?” failures and unusually poor sessions. The thread frames this as a possible silent model-serving change or “nerf,” but the comments provide no reproducible prompts, benchmark scores, latency data, or API/version identifiers to validate the regression.

  - **[Sonnet 5.5 did this. Opus 5.5 quality with half price.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1wtagdd/sonnet_55_did_this_opus_55_quality_with_half_price/)** (Activity: 2373): **A Reddit user reports using **Claude Sonnet 5.5** to generate a `30 s`, `1080p`, `60 fps` code-rendered Reddit-themed video: frames were drawn via **canvas in headless Chrome**, encoded with **ffmpeg**, and paired with synthesized audio—*“No After Effects, no stock footage, no video model.”* Based on transcript-derived token accounting, the project used `739k` output tokens, `101.6M` cache reads, `3.07M` cache writes, and `779` tool calls over ~`2.4 h`, with estimated API-equivalent cost of **$35.40 on Sonnet 5.5 vs $50.48 on Opus 5.5**; the author attributes the non-2× delta to cache reads costing `$0.20/M` on both models. The linked Reddit video could not be independently accessed due to a [`403 Forbidden`](https://v.redd.it/atz83anlqgsh1) block.** The main technical pushback is that applying Sonnet token usage to Opus pricing is not a valid model-cost comparison: Opus might consume a different number of tokens or tool iterations on the same task, so a controlled run with identical prompts would be needed. Other comments asked for the prompt and criticized the resulting video style as overusing transitions.

    - A commenter challenged the pricing claim, noting that comparing **Sonnet 5.5** output cost against **Opus 5.5** pricing is invalid unless the *same prompt* is run on both models. They emphasized that model cost-per-token alone is insufficient: if Sonnet is `2x` cheaper but consumes `3x` the tokens to achieve the same result, the total task cost could be higher.
    - A professional motion designer argued the generated video may look superficially impressive but is weak from a production-workflow perspective because users lose fine-grained control and editability. Their critique was that even if the output is usable for non-designers, it may be “essentially worthless” for professional motion design pipelines where iteration, timing, and asset-level editing matter.

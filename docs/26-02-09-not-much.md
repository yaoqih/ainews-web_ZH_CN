# AI Twitter Recap


**OpenAI’s Codex push (GPT‑5.3‑Codex) + “You can just build things” as a product strategy**

- **Super Bowl moment → Codex as the wedge**: OpenAI ran a Codex-centric Super Bowl ad anchored on “You can just build things” ([OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2020649757434327362); coverage in [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2020651347293716694), [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2020650521758179561)). The meta-story across the tweet set is that “builder tooling” (not chat) is becoming the mainstream consumer interface for frontier models.
- **Rollout and distribution**: OpenAI announced **GPT‑5.3‑Codex** rolling out across **Cursor, VS Code, and GitHub** with phased API access, explicitly flagging it as their **first “high cybersecurity capability”** model under the Preparedness Framework ([OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2020921792941166928); amplification by [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020940847190356092) and rollout rationale [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020940848159130094)). Cursor confirmed availability and preference internally (“noticeably faster than 5.2”) ([cursor_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/2020921643145519249)).
- **Adoption metrics + developer growth loop**: Sam Altman claimed **1M+ Codex App downloads in the first week** and **60%+ weekly user growth**, with intent to keep free-tier access albeit possibly reduced limits ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020977975081177343)). Multiple dev posts reinforce a “permissionless building” narrative, including Codex being used to port apps to iOS/Swift and menu bar tooling ([@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2020616390974353880), [@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2020986458455277986)).
- **Real-world friction points**: Engineers report that 5.3 can still be overly literal in UI labeling ([kylebrussell](https://twitter.com/kylebrussell/status/2020927139546358171)), and rollout hiccups are acknowledged (paused rollout noted by VS Code account later) ([code](https://twitter.com/code/status/2021041639926673503)). There’s also ecosystem tension around model availability/partnership expectations (e.g., Cursor/OpenAI dynamics debated) ([Teknium](https://twitter.com/Teknium/status/2020659530162692568), later contradicted by actual rollout landing).

**Claude Opus 4.6, “fast mode,” and evals moving into a post-benchmark era**

- **Opus 4.6 as the “agentic generalist” baseline**: A recurring theme is that **Claude Opus 4.6** is perceived as the strongest overall interactive agent, while Codex is closing the gap for coding workflows (summarized explicitly by [natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/2020885646555107619) and his longer reflection on “post-benchmark” model reading [natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/2020881482873811070)).
- **Leaderboard performance with important caveats**: Opus 4.6 tops both **Text** and **Code Arena** leaderboards, with Anthropic holding 4/5 in Code Arena top 5 in one snapshot ([arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2020956227795288132)). On the niche **WeirdML** benchmark, Opus 4.6 leads but is described as **extremely token-hungry** (average ~32k output tokens; sometimes hitting 128k cap) ([htihle](https://twitter.com/htihle/status/2020845875447074874); discussion by [scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020847174909665712)).
- **Serving economics and “fast mode” behavior**: Several tweets focus on throughput/latency economics and the practical experience of different serving modes (e.g., “fast mode” for Opus, batch-serving discussions) ([kalomaze](https://twitter.com/kalomaze/status/2020747180408230142), [dejavucoder](https://twitter.com/dejavucoder/status/2020803250920808493)).
- **Practical agent-building pattern**: People are building surprisingly large apps with agent SDKs (e.g., a local agentic video editor, ~10k LOC) ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020912965885538664)). The throughline is that models are “good enough” that *workflow design*, tool choice, and harness quality dominate.

**Recursive Language Models (RLMs): long-context via “programmatic space” and recursion as a capability multiplier**



- **Core idea (2 context pools)**: RLMs are framed as giving models a second, **programmatic context space** (files/variables/tools) plus the token space, with the model deciding what to bring into tokens—turning long-context tasks into coding-style decomposition ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020723909491114294), [dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020723910724174283)). This is positioned as a generally applicable *test-time* strategy with lots of optimization headroom ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020994879078400408)).
- **Open-weights proof point**: The paper authors note they **post-trained and released** an open-weights **RLM‑Qwen3‑8B‑v0.1**, reporting a “marked jump in capability” and suggesting recursion might be “not too hard” to teach even at 8B scale ([lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/2020877152854409691)).
- **Hands-on implementation inside coding agents**: Tenobrus implemented an RLM-like recursive skill *within* Claude Code using bash/files as state; the demo claim is better full-book processing (Frankenstein named characters) vs naive single-pass behavior ([tenobrus](https://twitter.com/tenobrus/status/2020770310958768449)). This is important because it suggests RLM behavior can be partially realized as a **pattern** (harness + recursion) even before native model-level support.
- **Why engineers care**: RLM is repeatedly framed as “next big thing” because it operationalizes long-context and long-horizon work *without* assuming infinite context windows, and it aligns with agent tool-use primitives already common in coding agents ([DeryaTR_](https://twitter.com/DeryaTR_/status/2020978003963244838)).

**MoE + sparsity + distributed training innovations (and skepticism about top‑k routing)**

- **New MoE comms pattern: Head Parallelism**: A highlighted systems result is **Multi‑Head LatentMoE + Head Parallelism**, aiming for **O(1) communication volume** w.r.t. number of activated experts, deterministic traffic, and better balance; claimed up to **1.61× faster** than standard MoE with expert parallelism and up to **4× less inter‑GPU communication (k=4)** ([TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2020884031630610484), [TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2020884105886593325)). This is exactly the kind of design that makes “>1000 experts” plausible operationally (commentary in [teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020767825715929332)).
- **Community tracking of sparsity**: Elie Bakouch compiled a visualization of expert vs parameter sparsity across many recent open MoEs (GLM, Qwen, DeepSeek, ERNIE 5.0, etc.) ([eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/2020956220694171718)).
- **Pushback on MoE ideology**: There’s a countercurrent arguing “MoE should die” in favor of unified latent spaces and flexible conditional computation; routing collapse and non-differentiable top‑k are called out as chronic issues ([teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020915555151040829)). Net: engineers like MoE for throughput but are looking for the next conditional compute paradigm that doesn’t bring MoE’s failure modes.

**China/open-model pipeline: GLM‑5 rumors, ERNIE 5.0 report, Kimi K2.5 in production, and model architecture diffusion**



- **GLM‑5 的新细节（传闻阶段，但具有具体技术细节）**：多条推文声称 **GLM‑5 规模“庞大”**；其中一条断言其拥有 **745B 参数** ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020840989947298156))，另一条则声称其总参数量是 **GLM‑4.5 的 2 倍**，并采用 “DeepSeek sparse attention” 以实现高效的长上下文处理 ([eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/2020824645868630065))。此外，还有提到 “GLM MoE DSA” 已进入 Transformers 库（暗示了架构上的实验性及其在下游的可用性）([xeophon](https://twitter.com/xeophon/status/2020815776890909052))。
- **Kimi K2.5 作为实用的“执行模型”**：Qoder 报告称 **Kimi K2.5** 在 **SWE‑bench Verified 上达到了 76.8%**，并将其定位为执行阶段的高性价比选择（“使用 Ultimate/Performance 档位进行规划，使用 K2.5 进行执行”）([qoder_ai_ide](https://twitter.com/qoder_ai_ide/status/2020739503812387074))。各大基础设施提供商（如 Tinker API）发布的可用性公告进一步证实，“部署覆盖面”也是竞争的一部分 ([thinkymachines](https://twitter.com/thinkymachines/status/2020927620872011940))。
- **ERNIE 5.0 技术报告**：ERNIE 5.0 报告发布；反馈显示其训练细节可能很有趣，但对其模型质量尤其是 post-training 阶段持怀疑态度（“在 post-training 方面表现不佳”）([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020863398162972822), [teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020867552356778427))。
- **通过 n‑grams 进行 Embedding 增强**：一个技术讨论串对比了 DeepSeek 的 **Engram** 与 **SCONE**：前者是对 n‑gram embedding 进行直接 backprop 训练并注入网络深层，而后者则是提取 n‑gram 并在输入层级使用 ([gabriberton](https://twitter.com/gabriberton/status/2020612533502222459))。

**生产环境中的 Agent：Harness、可观测性、离线深度研究、多 Agent 现实检查以及基础设施经验**

- **Agent Harness 是真正的关键解锁**：多条推文达成共识，认为难点不在于“拥有一个 Agent”，而在于构建 **Harness**：评估、追踪、正确性检查和迭代调试循环（SQL trace harness 示例 [matsonj](https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/2020630608029036764)；“Agent 可观测性”事件及 LangSmith 追踪功能 [LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2020920906772521274)）。
- **离线“深度研究”轨迹生成**：OpenResearcher 提出了一种**完全离线**的流水线，使用 **GPT‑OSS‑120B**、本地检索器和 **10T-token 语料库** 来合成 100 轮以上的工具调用轨迹；据报道，SFT 将 **Nemotron‑3‑Nano‑30B‑A3B** 在 BrowseComp‑Plus 上的表现从 **20.8% 提升至 54.8%** ([DongfuJiang](https://twitter.com/DongfuJiang/status/2020946549422031040))。这是一个值得注意的工程方向：可重复且无速率限制（rate-limit-free）的深度研究轨迹。
- **全栈编码 Agent 需要基于执行的测试**：FullStack-Agent 引入了 **Development-Oriented Testing**（面向开发的测试）+ **Repository Back-Translation**（仓库回译）；在 “FullStack-Bench” 上的结果显示，与基准线相比，在后端/数据库方面提升巨大，且在数千条轨迹上训练 Qwen3‑Coder‑30B 带来了进一步的改进 ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020891961511809456))。这与从业者的抱怨相符，即 Agent 往往只会“交付模拟（mock）端点”。
- **多 Agent 怀疑论正变得正式化**：一个拟议的指标 Γ 试图将“真正的协作”与“仅仅是投入更多算力”区分开来，强调了通信爆炸和顺序执行性能下降的问题 ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2021013257348419670))。相关内容：Google 的研究摘要（通过新闻通讯发布）称，多 Agent 提升了可并行任务的表现，但损害了顺序任务的表现，强化了对照实验的必要性 ([dl_weekly](https://twitter.com/dl_weekly/status/2020935994787143726))。
- **推理服务 + 扩展经验 (vLLM, 自动扩缩容)**：AI21 描述了如何调优 vLLM 的吞吐量/延迟，以及一个关键的运维指标选择：根据**队列深度**（queue depth）而非 GPU 利用率进行自动扩缩容，强调 100% GPU 利用率并不等同于超负荷 ([AI21Labs](https://twitter.com/AI21Labs/status/2020787359285944746))。
- **Transformer “真正胜利”的定调**：一个高互动的共识认为，Transformer 的胜利并非源于边际准确率的提升，而是由于其跨模态的**架构组合性**（以 BLIP 为例）([gabriberton](https://twitter.com/gabriberton/status/2020595051609698764)；[koreansaas](https://twitter.com/koreansaas/status/2020631451461718375) 亦有共鸣）。

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Qwen3-Coder-Next Model Discussions

  - **[Do not Let the "Coder" in Qwen3-Coder-Next Fool You! It's the Smartest, General Purpose Model of its Size](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r0abpl/do_not_let_the_coder_in_qwen3codernext_fool_you/)** (Activity: 491): **The post discusses the capabilities of **Qwen3-Coder-Next**, a local LLM, highlighting its effectiveness as a general-purpose model despite its 'coder' label. The author compares it favorably to **Gemini-3**, noting its consistent performance and pragmatic problem-solving abilities, which make it suitable for stimulating conversations and practical advice. The model is praised for its ability to suggest relevant authors, books, or theories unprompted, offering a quality of experience comparable to Gemini-2.5/3, but with the advantage of local deployment, thus maintaining data privacy.** Commenters agree with the post's assessment, noting that the 'coder' tag implies a model trained for structured, logical reasoning, which enhances its general-purpose utility. Some users are surprised by its versatility and recommend it over other local models, emphasizing its ability to mimic the tone of other models like GPT or Claude when configured with specific tools.

    - The 'coder' tag in Qwen3-Coder-Next is beneficial because models trained for coding tasks tend to exhibit more structured and literal reasoning, which enhances their performance in general conversations. This structured approach allows for clearer logic paths, avoiding the sycophancy often seen in chatbot-focused models, which tend to validate user input without critical analysis.
    - A user highlights the model's ability to mimic the voice or tone of other models like GPT or Claude, depending on the tools provided. This flexibility is achieved by using specific call signatures and parameters, which can replicate Claude's code with minimal overhead. This adaptability makes Qwen3-Coder-Next a versatile choice for both coding and general-purpose tasks.
    - Coder-trained models like Qwen3-Coder-Next are noted for their structured reasoning, which is advantageous for non-coding tasks as well. This structured approach helps in methodically breaking down problems rather than relying on pattern matching. Additionally, the model's ability to challenge user input by suggesting alternative considerations is seen as a significant advantage over models that merely affirm user statements.



  - **[Qwen3 Coder Next as first "usable" coding model &lt; 60 GB for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/qwen3_coder_next_as_first_usable_coding_model_60/)** (Activity: 684): ****Qwen3 Coder Next** is highlighted as a significant improvement over previous models under 60 GB, such as GLM 4.5 Air and GPT OSS 20B, due to its speed, quality, and context size. It is an instruct MoE model that avoids internal thinking loops, offering faster token generation and reliable tool call handling. The model supports a context size of over `100k`, making it suitable for larger projects without excessive VRAM usage. The user runs it with `24 GB VRAM` and `64 GB system RAM`, achieving `180 TPS` prompt processing and `30 TPS` generation speed. The setup includes `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1` for increased TPS, and `temp 0` to prevent incorrect token generation. The model is compared in **OpenCode** and **Roo Code** environments, with OpenCode being more autonomous but sometimes overly so, while Roo Code is more conservative with permissions.** Commenters note that Qwen3-Coder-Next is replacing larger models like gpt-oss-120b due to its efficiency on systems with `16GB VRAM` and `64GB DDR5`. Adjusting `--ubatch-size` and `--batch-size` to `4096` significantly improves prompt processing speed. The model is also praised for its performance on different hardware setups, such as an M1 Max MacBook and RTX 5090, though larger quantizations like Q8_0 can reduce token generation speed.

    - andrewmobbs highlights the performance improvements achieved by adjusting `--ubatch-size` and `--batch-size` to 4096 on a 16GB VRAM, 64GB DDR5 system, which tripled the prompt processing speed for Qwen3-Coder-Next. This adjustment is crucial for agentic coding tasks with large context, as it reduces the dominance of prompt processing time over query time. The user also notes that offloading additional layers to system RAM did not significantly impact evaluation performance, and they prefer the IQ4_NL quant over MXFP4 due to slightly better performance, despite occasional tool calling failures.
    - SatoshiNotMe shares that Qwen3-Coder-Next can be used with Claude Code via llama-server, providing a setup guide link. On an M1 Max MacBook with 64GB RAM, they report a generation speed of 20 tokens per second and a prompt processing speed of 180 tokens per second, indicating decent performance on this hardware configuration.
    - fadedsmile87 discusses using the Q8_0 quant of Qwen3-Coder-Next with a 100k context window on an RTX 5090 and 96GB RAM. They note the model's capability as a coding agent but mention a decrease in token generation speed from 8-9 tokens per second for the first 10k tokens to around 6 tokens per second at a 50k full context, highlighting the trade-off between quantization size and processing speed.

  - **[Qwen3 Coder Next on M3 Ultra v.s. GX10](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1qzsynx/qwen3_coder_next_on_m3_ultra_vs_gx10/)** (Activity: 75): **The post discusses the use of the **Qwen3-Coder-Next** model on two different hardware setups: the **GX10** with `128GB` GPU memory and the **M3 Ultra** with `512GB` memory. The author highlights that the `80B` model is optimal for the GX10, especially when using `8-bit quantization`, allowing it to fit comfortably in the GPU memory. The M3 Ultra, while offering higher throughput, is noted to be `3x` more expensive than the GX10. The author is exploring CLI-based coding tools like **opencode** as alternatives to GitHub Copilot, emphasizing the sufficiency of open-source models for everyday coding tasks.** Commenters agree that local AI models are becoming a trend, with many advocating for the use of open-source models to avoid reliance on large AI companies. They share examples of local AI workflows and tools, such as a Local Meeting Assistant and a Terminal with AI Context support, to illustrate the viability of local solutions.



    - The discussion highlights the trend towards using local AI models for privacy and cost-effectiveness, with a focus on open-source solutions. One user shares their experience with local AI workflows, emphasizing that these models are sufficient for 90% of users' needs. They provide examples of local AI applications, such as a meeting assistant and a talking assistant, and suggest that the Qwen3 Coder Next model is viable for coding tasks if one can run an 80B model on their hardware.
    - A technical comparison is made between the GX10 and the Apple Silicon M3 Ultra, noting that the M3 Ultra can be maxed out with 256GB of RAM, whereas the GX10 lacks a 128GB option and only offers 96GB. The M3 Ultra is described as being approximately twice the price of the GX10 but provides a more comprehensive working environment, allowing for models to run in the background. Additionally, the AMD AI Max+ 395 is mentioned as a cheaper alternative, with similar performance to the GX10 according to llama.cpp benchmarks, although it has slower prefill speeds.
    - A user mentions the use of a specialized tool called `dgxtop` for monitoring GPU usage on DGX Spark setups, which is a replacement for `nvtop`. This tool is tailored for Sparks and is considered a good option for those using such hardware configurations. The link to the `dgxtop` GitHub repository is provided for further exploration.


### 2. Qwen3.5 and GLM 5 Model Announcements

  - **[GLM 5 is coming! spotted on vllm PR](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qzz0vr/glm_5_is_coming_spotted_on_vllm_pr/)** (Activity: 274): **The announcement of **GLM 5** was spotted in a [vllm pull request](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34124), indicating a potential update or release. The pull request suggests that GLM 5 might utilize a similar architecture to `deepseek3.2`, as seen in the code snippet `"GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM": ("deepseek_v2", "GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM")`, which parallels the structure of `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM`. This suggests a continuation or evolution of the architecture used in previous GLM models, such as `Glm4MoeForCausalLM`.** Commenters are hopeful for a flash version of GLM 5 and speculate on its cost-effectiveness for API deployment, expressing a preference for the model size to remain at `355B` parameters to maintain affordability.

    - Betadoggo_ highlights the architectural similarities between `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` and `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM`, suggesting that GLM 5 might be leveraging DeepSeek's optimizations. This is evident from the naming conventions and the underlying architecture references, indicating a potential shift in design focus towards more efficient model structures.
    - Alarming_Bluebird648 points out that the transition to `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` suggests the use of DeepSeek architectural optimizations. However, they note the lack of WGMMA or TMA support on consumer-grade GPUs, which implies that specific Triton implementations will be necessary to achieve reasonable local performance, highlighting a potential barrier for local deployment without specialized hardware.
    - FullOf_Bad_Ideas speculates on the cost-effectiveness of serving GLM 5 via API, expressing hope that the model size remains at 355 billion parameters. This reflects concerns about the scalability and economic feasibility of deploying larger models, which could impact accessibility and operational costs.

  - **[PR opened for Qwen3.5!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz23pp/pr_opened_for_qwen35/)** (Activity: 751): **The GitHub pull request for Qwen3.5 in the Hugging Face transformers repository indicates that the new series will include Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the start. The code in `modeling_qwen3_5.py` suggests the use of semi-linear attention, similar to the Qwen3-Next models. The Qwen3.5 series is expected to feature a `248k` vocabulary size, which could enhance multilingual capabilities. Additionally, both dense and mixture of experts (MoE) models will incorporate hybrid attention mechanisms from Qwen3-Next.** Commenters speculate on the potential release of Qwen3.5-9B-Instruct and Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Instruct models, highlighting the community's interest in the scalability and application of these models.



    - The Qwen3.5 model is expected to utilize a 248k sized vocabulary, which could significantly enhance its multilingual capabilities. This is particularly relevant as both the dense and mixture of experts (MoE) models are anticipated to incorporate hybrid attention mechanisms from Qwen3-Next, potentially improving performance across diverse languages.
    - Qwen3.5 is noted for employing semi-linear attention, a feature it shares with Qwen3-Next. This architectural choice is likely aimed at optimizing computational efficiency and scalability, which are critical for handling large-scale data and complex tasks in AI models.

**5. Security & Platform Risk: KYC, Leaks, and “Your Prompt Is Just Text”**

- ****Discord KYC Face-Scan Panic Meets Reality****: Multiple communities reacted to reports that Discord will require **biometric face scans/ID verification** globally starting next month (Latent Space linked a tweet: [disclosetv claim](https://x.com/disclosetv/status/2020875244223815801)), with BASI users worrying biased face recognition could lock out regions.
  - The thread veered into migration ideas (GPU MODE mentioned [Stoat](https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web) and [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat)) and gallows humor (a BASI user joked about using *"a hotdog from that sex cartoon"* for verification).

- ****Z.ai Server Bug Report: “Internal Models Exposed”****: OpenRouter users reported serious **z.ai server vulnerabilities** allegedly enabling unauthorized access to internal models and sensitive data, saying outreach via Discord/Twitter failed to reach the team.
  - The discussion focused on escalation paths and responsible disclosure logistics rather than technical details, but the claim raised broader worries about provider-side security hygiene for model hosting.



- ****Indirect Jailbreaks & Prompt-Injection Skepticism Collide****: BASI Jailbreaking 用户表示，一次 **OpenClaw** 越狱尝试泄露了敏感信息，并认为 *间接越狱 (indirect jailbreaks)* 更难防范，因为无论 System Prompt 如何，底层的平台漏洞都可能被利用（OpenClaw 仓库也被作为一个持久内存示例：[steve-vincent/openclaw](https://github.com/steve-vincent/openclaw)）。
  - 在同一个服务器中，一名红队人员质疑 Prompt Injection 是否算作一种独特的威胁，因为从 LLM 的角度来看 *“指令、工具、用户输入和安全提示词都是一样的：text in > text out”*，而其他人则认为系统仍然需要硬性边界（如容器隔离）来使这种区别具有实际意义。

> `Open Sourcing of Older Competitions, AI Labs Training Models, Kernel Performance and Optimization, Competition Data Analysis, Cheating Detection and Prevention` 


- **Past KernelBot Competition Data Dumped!**: The datasets from the older **GPU MODE KernelBot competitions** have been [open-sourced on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GPUMODE/kernelbot-data) for AI labs to train models, containing the first **3 problems**.
   - One can analyze submissions, such as sorting one by time to see how the author got to their fast solutions.
- **Competitors explore GEMV and BF16**: Members are experimenting with **bf16 qwen3-0.6b inference** on **sm_120**, one getting **765 tok/s** decode after optimizations, but would need to remove the **nvfp4 parts** and cannot do gemv.
   - One devasted by losing a 5090 instance before committing changes, later getting 727 tok/s, while another says their submitted kernel should work *out of the box*.
- **Raw Cuda Dominates Kernel Competition!**: Competition data shows **raw CUDA** with **CuTe DSL** is the prominent technique, while **Triton** and **CUTLASS** are less popular, and also showed [submission times improved over time](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1469568531291967518/1469568959971070174/Screenshot_2026-02-06_at_9.42.12_PM.png?ex=698b6dff&is=698a1c7f&hm=c7bedb12e3a7cb3241781de0da1fcef5079af2509a4079445a4931eda6c5f703&).
   - One member noted that **CuTe DSL** is a Python DSL equivalent of CuTe C++ and managed to one-shot **22 us**.
- **AI Models Becoming Crafty Hackers**: The community is grappling with AI models exploiting loopholes in the evaluation script, with one member considering it *a hack of the metric* rather than a genuine improvement, prompting discussions on creating a better eval.
   - The proposed solution involves **AI reviewing submissions**, addressing concerns about cheating and flawed human evaluations, with one user joking *AGI is when the agents stop cheating the first thing they try*.
- **GPU MODE feels the Financial Pinch**: Due to budget overruns from high resource usage, the competition organizers requested participants to use **NVIDIA runners** instead of **Modal**, and implemented a rate limit of **one submission per user per hour on Modal**.
   - Spam timeout runs to Modal are a big factor in insane money spending, with **8 runs costing $5 for nothing**.

- **Duck Overview Leads User to Pile Dataset**: A user landed on the server after a **Duck AI Overview** mentioned the **Pile Dataset** as a source for text training data.
   - When asked if the user needed the OG Pile, the user responded that *someone else was asking for that I believe*.
- **Alignment is a Systems Engineering Problem?**: A user suggested that **AI Alignment** might be a **systems engineering problem**, requiring governance, routing, and auditability rather than just training.
   - Another member commented that Alignment *sounds like bullshit to me*, while another responded *Alignment is good business sense, if you're selling AI services*.
- **Alignment is a Moral Issue**: A user considers **alignment to be a philosophical issue**, akin to the general problem of steerability, interpretability, and coherence in reasoning, which attempts to create AI systems that follow human values.
   - This sparked a debate on whose values should be used, referencing Radically Free Speech-ians vs. Safety Advocates and the importance of not just setting goals, but also the *how*.
- **Bucket Exploit Analogy for Alignment Failure**: A user shared a scenario of a speedrunner exploiting a physics glitch in a game to steal items, highlighting a failure mode where **AI follows rules but violates the intended outcome**.

> `Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Model Upscaling, Taylor Series Approximation of Attention, Prompt Response Datasets` 


- **Online LSH gets Neat Upgrade**: A member discussed [Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03270), noting that it's been explored extensively, and this is **LSH**, except the hash function (centroids/hyperplanes) is learned online.
   - They suggested that KS (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) could be applied instead of gaussian regression, betting it would work very well.
- **Power Retention Approximates Attention with Taylor Series**: Members discussed a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00294v1) which uses part of the **full Taylor series** instead of just a power and claims to approximate attention so closely that you can't even see it past float16 precision.
   - One member quipped, *"if you really really squint, you can maybe make out the difference between the 4th power taylor series and exp"*.
- **Piecewise Taylor Approximations Debated**: The discussion extended to the use of piecewise functions of **Taylor approximations** with reasonable clipping, which led to questions about how to apply a piecewise function in linear attention, given that `(q@k.T)@v` is done as `q@(k.T@v)` in linear attention.
   - It was argued that the whole point of **exp()** in attention is to separate things that would otherwise be nearby one another, and limiting the interval defeats the purpose, as softmax is a soft version of 'max', intended to separate out nearby elements so only the maximum element shows through - referencing [this Tweet](https://fxtwitter.com/i/status/2019308224223354936) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04770v1).

- **Instruction Format Datasets Desired**: A member inquired about good **prompt response datasets** for training a model, noting that they only seem to find raw data datasets, not prompt response pair datasets.
   - Another member suggested searching for **instruction format** or **chat format datasets**.

- **Subtask Independence Myth Busted**: A member suggests that the subtasks usually aren’t independent, so success doesn’t just multiply cleanly across steps, instead, correlations and bottlenecks matter, which is where the apparent emergence comes from, which implies that **subtask independence** isn't a valid assumption.
   - The member states that what they find interesting is that once you add **regulation or control layers**, capability can improve underneath while certain behaviors stay suppressed.
- **Architectural Shifts Spur Scaling Visibility**: A member states that when a threshold flips, it suddenly looks like a jump, but overall it still follows scaling behavior, though the **architecture changes** when that emergence becomes visible.
   - This perspective highlights the importance of considering architectural changes to understand emergence and **scaling behavior**.

> `Kimi MI300 Optimization, Chinese Accelerator Meeting, Kernel Optimization Game, Flash Attention Derivation, GLM-4.7 Quant Bounty` 


- **Gamified Kernel Optimization is Coming Soon**: George Hotz wants *an interactive game for kernel optimization that humans and agents can play*, with a [prototype now available](https://kernel-flow.vercel.app/) and the [repo open-sourced](https://github.com/mrfixit-stickyhash/KernelFlow).
- **Flash Attention Doesn't Fully Auto-Derive**: Deriving online softmax (flash attention) requires doing tricks that compilers don't do, so **tinygrad** could be modified to perform those tricks, but it's harder to make compilers do it automatically.
   - Flash attention includes fusing the attention, online softmax, and block matmul; fusing avoids saving the attention matrix, online softmax splits the softmax, and block matmul uses tensor cores.
- **Huawei's FlashAttention Implementation**: **FlashAttention** can be implemented effectively even without Ampere's features, as demonstrated by Huawei in their fastattention paper, though optimal performance requires hardware-aware optimization.
   - Proper export infrastructure is now available if you are interested.
- **CPU Kernel Optimization Boosts Performance**: A custom **matvec kernel for CPU** has been added, gated by a feature flag, resulting in a performance jump from **2.16 tok/s to 5.59 tok/s**, sometimes surpassing **torch**.
   - The author clarified they're not using hand-coded MSL kernels and working within **tinygrad** to maintain portability.
- **Upstreaming for Bounties**: To claim bounties, changes must be upstreamed, with better sorting, dtype unpacking, fusion, and contiguous memory handling being preferred techniques.
   - A huge number of specific hand coded kernels wouldn't be upstreamed, but something like what George did for embedded might.

- **CPU Decoding Bottleneck Identified in Llama 1B**: A member has been working on heuristics and devectorizer to optimize CPU decodes, identifying **matvec** and **matmul** as the primary bottlenecks for **Llama 1B** decoding.
   - They suggest a custom kernel for **matvec** on CPU, as it could be *readable and understandable*, and empirically, improving **matvec** brings tinygrad to parity with torch.
- **Failed Optimization Attempts on Tinygrad Pipeline**: The member reported that early optimization attempts, while sometimes outperforming **Torch**, resulted in broken tests related to **specifications** and **expected types** in the **tinygrad pipeline**.
   - The member admitted to not spending the time to actually understand the tinygrad pipeline, thus resulting in *messy attempts*.
- **Device-Specific Heuristics Enhancement**: The member suggests that device-specific rules in **heuristic.py** could enhance performance, mentioning that adapting **opts** to native vector widths on **CPU** improves **LLVM's SIMD code generation** with better register and cache utilization.
   - They are hoping to tackle similar CPU problems/bounties in the future.

> `Kernel regression GAN, Gradient Flow and Optimal Transport, Drifting vs Diffusion Speed, Experiment tracking tools, Standard evaluation tools` 


- ****Kernel Regression GANs Rival MMD****: A member breaks down a paper, explaining it is basically a **GAN** where the discriminator is a **kernel regression model** and very close to just being **MMD**.
   - Another member notes that the main difference between **MMD** and this is that MMD uses the **kernel mean embeddings**, while they use a **Nadaraya-Watson Kernel regressor** (which is normalised) for their mean-shift based algorithm.
- ****Optimal Transport Ties Back to Gradient Flow****: A member observes that many concepts tie back to **gradient flow** and **optimal transport** and asks how to generally understand how **convexity** is gained or lost.
   - Another member responds that **gradient flows** are not the same as **optimal transport**: **OT** can just be implemented as a **gradient flow** since it is linear.
- ****Drifting Gains Speed on Diffusion****: A member asks about the speed implications of **drifting** vs **diffusion**, linking to a promising repo: [Infatoshi/driftin](https://github.com/Infatoshi/driftin).
   - A member notes that while the repo produces lower quality than **SOTA diffusion models**, *it only does one forward pass through the model.*
- ****Experiment Tracking Tooling Troubles****: One member asks for recommendations for experiment tracking, noting many options are dead or lightly supported, with WandB and Neptune not options.
   - They are looking for a solution with advanced support for queries (filtering, synthesis) and graphs, which can support multiple concurrent runs in one project.
- ****TDD Rumored in Agentic SDLCs****: A member heard that a lot of big tech is using **TDD** for their **agentic SDLCs**.
   - Another member replies that this is true, noting this approach has been known for 70 years to turn **probabilistic logics** to **deterministic** ones using **feedback loops**.

- **Aider's Markdown Woes**: A member expressed difficulty in getting **Aider** to work effectively with **markdown files** using models like **Gemini**, **Qwen**, and **Kimi**.
   - They stated they burned through tokens despite controlling context and would consider re-integrating if **Aider** supported subscriptions and markdown generation.
- **Exploring Alternatives to Aider**: A member uses **Antigravity**, **Gemini CLI**, **Open Code**, and custom scripts for conceptual development, leveraging subscriptions to reduce costs.
   - They shared a [Python library](https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1133060505792159755/1441924939174379642) to manage **Aider**, bypassing the CLI for better monitoring, noting it wasn't designed for such integration.
- **Subscription Model Economizes Token Usage**: A member noted that using paid subscriptions for models is far more economical, costing about **4%** of what API usage would.
   - They opt for subscriptions for large context chats and file writing, and use APIs through **OpenRouter** for smaller chats.
- **Claude Surpasses Expectations**: A member humorously remarked on **Claude's** speed, joking that *it thinks and writes faster than I can even read it.*
   - Another member asked how to review it, and another person jokes they are *too cheap* to review it in an effective manner.

> `Aider's --auto-accept-architect setting, Together AI max_tokens issue, LLMs and software design principles (SOLID, TDD, BDD), Experiences with Aider's interaction model (yes/no questions), Gastown term` 


- ****Aider's Auto-Accept Architect Setting Causes Headaches****: A user discussed the `--auto-accept-architect` setting in Aider, noting it defaults to `True` and can be disabled to prevent automatic acceptance of architecture changes, and mentioned the [official docs](https://aider.chat/docs/config/options.html).
   - The user found the default behavior problematic given LLMs' tendency to exceed scope, and encountered issues where Aider presented **yes/no questions** even when nuanced input was needed, suggesting this [negatively impacts usability](https://aider.chat/).
- ****Together AI demands max_tokens in header****: To get Together AI to work with Aider, the `max_tokens` parameter has to be in the header via the `~/.aider.model.settings.yml` config.
   - Even though this works, it seems to treat **max_tokens** as the maximum number of _output_ tokens, and members sought ways to [calculate this automatically](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues).
- ****LLMs: Friend or Foe to SOLID?****: A user pondered whether LLMs consider **SOLID principles**, and if they are capable of **TDD** or **BDD**.
   - They posited that AI prompts might be a form of BDD without the refactoring, and jokingly expressed concerns about the technical debt that might accumulate and pointed to a future where [human experts are needed to clean up the mess](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04).
- ****Aider and agentic tools can explain architecture****: Members discussed how agentic tools like Aider are helpful for explaining design and architecture with breadcrumbs in chat history and git commits.
   - This offers a good opportunity to [learn how software has already been made and can be made](https://gastownhall.ai/).

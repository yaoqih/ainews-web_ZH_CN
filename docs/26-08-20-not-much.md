# AI Twitter Recap


**OpenAI and Anthropic Expand the Agent Product Surface**

- **OpenAI pushed several desktop and builder features in one wave**: [@ChatGPT](https://x.com/ChatGPT/status/2090499359641329950) launched an **Apple Messages plugin** for ChatGPT Work/Codex on Mac, enabling message search, catch-up, drafting, and sending from the desktop app. [@OpenAIDevs](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2090515079058108745) also added **collaborative editing for ChatGPT Sites**, with teammates sharing a project while Codex manages git/CI; [shared read-only conversation links](https://x.com/ChatGPT/status/2090517084262551917) and [PR-context sharing](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2090555241343418814) further push ChatGPT/Codex toward being a coordination surface, not just a chat UI. On the API side, [transparent backgrounds in GPT-Image-2](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2090536933571330440) are now in preview for reusable design assets.
- **OpenAI’s desktop memory/workflow features continue rolling out geographically**: [@OpenAIDevs](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2090487766442512398) said **Computer History** and cross-app memory are now available in the **EEA, UK, and Switzerland** for Pro/Business/Enterprise Mac users, with [Record & Replay](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2090487779587477626) also live there. Together, these features point to a product strategy of capturing user workflows on-device and turning repeated actions into reusable skills.
- **Anthropic made its agent platform more composable and production-ready**: [@ClaudeDevs](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2090540270219567575) announced general availability for **computer use, browser tool, Skills API, and Files API** on the Claude Platform. The [Skills API](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2090540273939996958) adds versioned reusable procedures; the [Files API](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2090540275357606263) now supports expiration control, **5x higher rate limits** to **500 RPM**, and **1 TB/org**. Anthropic also published an [AG-UI adapter for Claude Managed Agents](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2090511582531072265), mapping chat threads to managed sessions and streaming text, tool calls, and thinking into custom UIs.

**Model Economics, Usage Limits, and the Enterprise Shift Toward Open Models**



- **AT&T became the clearest public case study yet for hybrid routing**: the most consequential enterprise datapoint in the set came via [@Hesamation](https://x.com/Hesamation/status/2090518831349268851), summarizing AT&T’s internal AI deployment: **40% of employee AI usage already routes to open models**, with a target of **60–70%**; **coding costs are down 56%** for only a **2% quality drop**, at **45B tokens/day**. That supports the increasingly common view that frontier closed models remain reserved for the hardest tasks, while “good-enough” open models eat the broad middle of enterprise demand. [@amir](https://x.com/amir/status/2090515013635305683) explicitly framed this as a warning sign for OpenAI/Anthropic’s enterprise moat, while [@ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/2090601698402447748) welcomed AT&T to open models.
- **Pricing pressure is intensifying across closed-model distribution**: [@eglyman](https://x.com/eglyman/status/2090521785909309572) announced **GPT-5.6 Sol at 50% off** through Router, and both [@github](https://x.com/github/status/2090577927905874389) and [@code](https://x.com/code/status/2090583188326187464) amplified the temporary discount for GitHub Copilot / VS Code users. At the same time, user sentiment suggests supply constraints are surfacing as usage caps rather than degraded quality: [@bridgemindai](https://x.com/bridgemindai/status/2090386359743893620) complained that a **$200/mo OpenAI Pro plan** could be exhausted in a single heavy Codex day, and [@theo](https://x.com/theo/status/2090621019476427174) noted it was possible to continue consuming substantial tokens after hitting the stated cap. The broader signal: labs are still searching for the right product boundary between high-end model access and economically sustainable agentic usage.
- **Open-weight adoption and distribution continue to broaden**: [@ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/2090505028998140182) said **Kimi K3** is now rolled out to over half its subscription base with **US/EU hosting** and **zero data retention**. On the open ecosystem side, [@Google](https://x.com/Google/status/2090497445826322464) and [@osanseviero](https://x.com/osanseviero/status/2090490264112738579) highlighted **Gemma surpassing 1B downloads**, while [@_philschmid](https://x.com/_philschmid/status/2090485095396180034) launched an **Awesome Gemma** repo aggregating variants, deployment guides, and fine-tuning recipes.

**Multimodal and Agent Benchmarks: Muse Spark, GLM-5.3, Gemini 3.7 Flash**

- **Meta’s Muse Spark 1.2 had a strong benchmark day across multimodal/agentic evals**: [@AIatMeta](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/2090485743034716420) presented demos spanning **visual coding, robotics planning, and audio-visual understanding**, and previewed [WildArtifactBench](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/2090505413817246050), an internal eval using **win rates and Elo from human/agentic judges** for practical multimodal tasks. Third-party measurements were favorable: [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2090484142408618033) reported **+2.1% net improvement** in Agent Arena, up from **0.9%** in v1.1, with particularly strong **Bash Recovery (+11.4%)**; [@DesignArena](https://x.com/DesignArena/status/2090498670685020639) placed Muse Spark 1.2 **#1 for Video-to-Website**, **#2 for Image-to-HTML**, and **#3 for Image-to-Frontend**, while noting it sits on the **price-preference Pareto frontier**.
- **Zhipu’s GLM-5.3 keeps showing up in agentic/code evals**: [@AutoClawAIer](https://x.com/AutoClawAIer/status/2090446256342708724) announced **GLM-5.3 integration into AutoClaw**, Z.ai’s work agent. More importantly, [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2090581559262798055) said **GLM-5.3 Max** shifts the **Code Arena: WebDev Pareto frontier**, projecting to **#2 among open models** and **#8 overall** at **1597 pts** and **$3.65/M**. Separately, [@ZixuanLi_](https://x.com/ZixuanLi_/status/2090564295696306436) resurfaced **SAO (Single-Rollout Asynchronous Optimization)** as a key GLM-5.2/5.3 RL advance for stable asynchronous agentic RL.
- **Gemini 3.7 Flash keeps accumulating “cheap and strong” evidence**: [@arcprize](https://x.com/arcprize/status/2090500144550539327) reported **ARC-AGI-2: 84.6% at $0.25/task** and **ARC-AGI-1: 95.5% at $0.12/task**, making Gemini 3.7 Flash stand out on cost-adjusted reasoning performance. [@JonathanJarvis](https://x.com/JonathanJarvis/status/2090479013344993579) separately called it excellent for **agentic vision tasks**.

**Infra, Hardware, and Systems Work: Rubin, Cerebras, Linux Agents, Caching**



- **OpenAI’s next pretraining stack is moving onto Rubin**: [@udayruddarraju](https://x.com/udayruddarraju/status/2090343188393246973) posted that OpenAI’s first **NVIDIA Vera Rubin racks** are now installed and running the training stack, explicitly tied to **next-generation frontier pre-training**. [@gdb](https://x.com/gdb/status/2090515992506147198) called it a major milestone in the OpenAI-NVIDIA partnership.
- **Cerebras’ CS-4 drew attention for inference scaling without a node shrink**: [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2090468333476860347) summarized the launch as essentially doubling performance on the same **5nm wafer**, **4T transistors**, and **900k AI cores**, via redesigned power delivery and cooling. Reported specs include **250 PFLOPs per WSE-3 Turbo**, **43.2 PB/s memory bandwidth**, and a **3-wafer CS-4 rack** at **750 PFLOPs**. The notable claim for practitioners: **4,400+ tok/s per user on GPT-OSS-120B**, up to **30x faster** than GPU-based systems.
- **Agent runtime ergonomics are becoming a systems bottleneck**: [@theo](https://x.com/theo/status/2090528543746965991) argued that **Linux materially outperforms macOS for agent workloads**, especially on filesystem-heavy operations. [@Qdrant_engine](https://x.com/qdrant_engine/status/2090461354557673915) shared a practical semantic-caching writeup showing **57.1% hit rate**, **55.7% fewer tokens**, and **~15 ms** hit latency. [@MParakhin](https://x.com/MParakhin/status/2090494322101957006) pushed **gisting** as an underused production technique, citing **~40% lower end-to-end latency** and **~15% higher throughput** with better results, and linked a [Shopify engineering writeup](https://x.com/MParakhin/status/2090495141371093407).

**Agents, Memory, and Harness-Centric Learning**

- **Chroma launched a research preview of self-improving memory**: [@jeffreyhuber](https://x.com/jeffreyhuber/status/2090466566743974191) announced **Foundation**, Chroma’s approach to agent memory, built from prior agent sessions. This landed amid a broader shift from “single-shot agent” thinking toward persistent harnesses with accumulated state, skills, and memories.
- **The most interesting agent research in the set was about harness evolution, not model weights**: [@omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2090533587066249514) highlighted a paper on **harness continual learning**, where prompts, memories, skills, and routing rules evolve independently of the model. The key failure mode is **harness-level forgetting**: improving one component can silently break previously reliable behavior. The proposed solution, **guarded harness evolution**, separates proposing updates from committing them, with reported **>10% gains** across textual, multimodal, and open-world tasks.
- **Related negative results matter too**: [@dair_ai](https://x.com/dair_ai/status/2090559561128407336) flagged a study showing that memory-based self-improving agents look worse once you control for **task order effects** and **evaluation variance**. [@omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2090466402809561334) also summarized a paper arguing post-training agents tend to **lock into an initial strategy early** and spend the remaining budget on local refinement rather than revisiting the strategic choice itself.

**Top Tweets (by engagement)**

- **ChatGPT desktop + Messages**: [@ChatGPT’s Apple Messages plugin launch](https://x.com/ChatGPT/status/2090499359641329950) was the single biggest product tweet in the set and reflects the shift toward desktop-native, action-taking assistants.
- **AT&T’s open-model routing economics**: [@Hesamation’s summary](https://x.com/Hesamation/status/2090518831349268851) is arguably the most strategically important enterprise datapoint: **40% open now, 60–70% later, 56% coding cost reduction**.
- **OpenAI’s Rubin racks**: [@udayruddarraju](https://x.com/udayruddarraju/status/2090343188393246973) provided a rare concrete infrastructure signal about frontier pretraining scale-up.
- **Claude Platform GA for computer use / Skills / Files**: [@ClaudeDevs](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2090540270219567575) marked a significant maturity step for Anthropic’s agent platform.
- **Gemini 3.7 Flash on ARC-AGI**: [@arcprize](https://x.com/arcprize/status/2090500144550539327) reinforced Google’s positioning around strong low-cost reasoning.

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Qwen3.8-27B Quantization and Coding Benchmarks



  - **[Introducing Qwen3.8-27B Dynamic v3 Unsloth GGUFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vsr67c/introducing_qwen3827b_dynamic_v3_unsloth_ggufs/)** (Activity: 2059): **The [image](https://i.redd.it/it09zxtsxckh1.jpeg) is a technical announcement graphic for **Unsloth Dynamic v3.0 GGUF quantizations** of **Qwen3.8-27B**, claiming `>10%` better top-1 accuracy at the same model size versus other quant providers. It highlights post-training quantization only—no QAT/QAD and no training on the imatrix calibration dataset—plus memory targets from **1-bit quants runnable on ~8GB RAM** up to BF16, with evaluation framed around **Divergence-300 @32**, KLD, and top-1% accuracy comparisons. The linked release points to the Unsloth blog and Hugging Face GGUF repo: https://unsloth.ai/docs/basics/dynamic-3.0-ggufs and https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF.** Commenters were broadly positive but asked for more comparative data, especially adding the prior **Qwen 3.8 27B UD 2.0** quants to the chart so users can judge whether upgrading is worthwhile. One user also noted practical hardware interest: whether `IQ4XS` can now run on `16GB` VRAM without MTP.

    - Users requested **comparative quantization metrics** against the prior **Qwen 3.8 27B UD 2.0** GGUFs, specifically asking for **KLD** and/or **top-1** error lines on the graph so existing local files can be directly compared to the new Dynamic v3 quants.
    - A technical point was raised that the new **IQ4XS** quant may fit within **`16 GB` VRAM without MTP**, which would be significant for single-GPU local inference if quality degradation remains low. Another user noted the apparent **`~15 GB` size for Q4_K_M**, asking whether it preserves quality well enough to be practically useful.
    - One commenter asked for more granular evaluation now that **oobabooga** is involved, specifically **per-category KLD** and **KV-cache quantization KLD** metrics similar to those shown by [localbench.substack.com](https://localbench.substack.com/), to better understand where quantization loss appears across tasks and cache settings.

  - **[Qwen3.8-27B took a serious hit to *knowledge* vs 3.6](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vt7l3e/qwen3827b_took_a_serious_hit_to_knowledge_vs_36/)** (Activity: 758): **Users report **Qwen3.8-27B** regresses vs **Qwen3.6-27B** on offline/weight-only factual recall, aligning with lower scores on Artificial Analysis’s [Omniscience knowledge benchmark](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/omniscience?models=qwen3-6-27b%2Cqwen3-8-27b#omniscience-accuracy-tabs). The observed tradeoff is that Qwen3.8 appears stronger for **tool calling, coding, and agentic workflows**, but weaker when web/search tools are disabled for obscure trivia, historical/location identification, or airgapped knowledge retrieval.** Commenters generally frame this as an intentional or acceptable specialization tradeoff: Qwen 3.x may be shifting toward coding/agentic use where external retrieval is expected, while models like **Gemma** may be preferable for broad “mini Google” factual recall. One commenter explicitly preferred not allocating parameters to niche trivia if it improves coding performance.

    - Several commenters converged on the view that **Qwen 3.8-27B appears optimized away from memorized factual recall and toward coding/agentic workflows**. One user reported that with web search/fetch disabled, Qwen 3.8 regressed on niche knowledge tasks such as identifying stamps, historical locations, and old photos, while tool calling and coding were *“impressive”* when retrieval tools were available.
    - The discussion framed the regression as a deliberate parameter-capacity tradeoff for a `27B` model: reduce obscure memorized knowledge while preserving reasoning, coding, and tool-use competence. Commenters suggested using other models such as **Gemma** for trivia or broad factual recall, while positioning Qwen 3.x as better suited to agentic tasks that retrieve information externally before acting on it.
    - One technically interesting speculation was around future **modular model knowledge/skill extensions**, described as “neural plugins” similar to **LoRAs**. The proposed architecture would keep the base model lean while adding native domain or language competence—e.g. Japanese support or financial-services knowledge—through optional plugins rather than baking all knowledge into the base model.



  - **[I ran Qwen3.8-27B against Opus, Sonnet, GPT and others. Results inside.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1vst6ua/i_ran_qwen3827b_against_opus_sonnet_gpt_and/)** (Activity: 422): **The image is a **benchmark dashboard** for the author’s home-built coding eval comparing **Qwen3.8-27B**, **DS4 0731**, **GPT-5.6-sol**, **Opus 5**, **Sonnet 5**, and **Haiku 4.5** across algorithm tests, repo bugfix/feature tasks, wall-clock completion time, and blind-judged code quality ([image](https://i.redd.it/m2o5ur8z8dkh1.png)). The main technical takeaway is that **GPT-5.6-sol** leads overall with perfect repo-task performance and near-perfect algorithms, while local models are surprisingly competitive: **Qwen3.8-27B xhigh** scores strongly on hard algorithms and “surgical fixes” but is much slower, and **DS4 0731** achieves `8/8` on both repo tiers despite being a `2-bit` local quantization. The author notes a practical tradeoff: higher “thinking” improves some hard reasoning/code-quality cases but can overthink, increase latency, and even reduce repo-task accuracy compared with medium thinking.** Commenters questioned benchmark saturation and task difficulty, arguing that if nearly all models score near the top then the eval may not distinguish frontier/local capability well. Others asked for more detail on the definitions of “algorithm” and “repo work” tasks, expected outputs, and hidden test design to make the results more reproducible and interpretable.

    - Several commenters argued the benchmark appears **saturated**, with *“all models at the top”*, making it hard to distinguish Qwen3.8-27B from Opus, Sonnet, GPT, and others. One analogy framed it as testing stronger models on tasks too easy to separate capability, implying the suite needs harder or more discriminative evaluations.
    - A commenter requested more precise methodology for the **“algorithm”** and **“repo work”** tasks, specifically asking for expanded task descriptions and expected results. This points to reproducibility concerns: without clear prompts, grading criteria, and target outputs, cross-model comparisons are difficult to interpret.
    - One technically relevant question asked what **“DNF”** means for **Qwen3.8 medium**, in the context of a comparison between **Qwen3.8 xhigh** and **medium** settings. This suggests the benchmark table included incomplete or failed runs, but the failure semantics were not defined clearly enough for readers to assess the result.




### 2. Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 Inference Speedups

  - **[DFlash2 speeds Qwen 3.8 27B up to 4 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vsuaoj/dflash2_speeds_qwen_38_27b_up_to_4_times/)** (Activity: 418): ****llama.cpp** PR [#27342](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/27342) adds `dflash2`; the OP benchmarked **Qwen 3.8 27B** on an **RTX 6000** across four prompts/decoding setups, reporting median throughput: baseline `47.4 tok/s`, `mtp` `114.7 tok/s`, `dflash` `99.3 tok/s`, and `dflash2` `140.6 tok/s`. This implies roughly **3× over baseline** and ~`22.6%` over MTP in this small test, but task-level speedups varied substantially, with one prompt only reaching ~`1.5×`; OP links the DFlash2 explanation at [inco.ai/blog/dflash2](https://inco.ai/blog/dflash2/).** Commenters questioned hardware sensitivity: one reported **Apple Silicon** could not beat their existing MTP configuration across multiple options/quants, and another asked what hardware benefits if both Apple and RTX 5090 users see limited gains. A tradeoff question was raised, but no concrete accuracy/acceptance/latency tradeoff data was provided in the supplied comments.

    - Users reported mixed hardware-dependent gains: one Apple Silicon user said DFlash2 could not beat their existing **MTP** configuration despite trying multiple options and quantizations, while another noted reports that **Apple Silicon** and **RTX 5090** setups may not benefit. This suggests the claimed speedup may be backend- or architecture-sensitive rather than universal.
    - A concrete benchmark-style report used **Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q6_K** with **Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-Q4_K_M** on a **Ryzen AI 9700 Pro** under Ubuntu, comparing **Vulkan** and **ROCm** with little difference. The user saw acceptance rates of `0.724` at position 1 and `0.468` at position 2, dropping sharply afterward, making `n-max=2` the practical setting and limiting realized speedup.

  - **[I pushed Qwen3.8-27B limits again... Dflash2 - 134 tps on a RTX 3090](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vsy4l2/i_pushed_qwen3827b_limits_again_dflash2_134_tps/)** (Activity: 367): **A new update to the RTX 3090-optimized **Qwen3.8-27B** inference stack reports ~`138 tok/s` single-request on real chat prompts, `942 tok/s` at `64` concurrency, and cached long-chat follow-up latency reduced from ~`23 s` to `0.85–1.35 s`; the repo is available at [syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090). Key changes include backported **DFlash2** speculative block drafting for vLLM `0.27.1`, a W4A16/GPTQ-int4 quantized drafter shrinking `3.85 GB` bf16 to `1.19 GB`, lookup-augmented drafting over prior token history, prefix caching for the hybrid Mamba/GDN model via `--mamba-cache-mode align`, and allocator/CUDA-graph fixes enabling `64k` context with DFlash2; quality is claimed unchanged at perplexity `8.09` and GSM8K `96.5%`. The author also notes a vLLM `0.27.1` bug where temperature-applied draft logits were cached instead of raw logits, which would make speculative verification use the wrong proposal distribution for `0 < T ≠ 1`; artifacts include the [W4A16 DFlash2 drafter](https://huggingface.co/syvai/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-W4A16) and [fast-variant tensors](https://huggingface.co/syvai/qwen3.8-27b-3090-fast-variant).** Commenters were mostly impressed rather than deeply critical, with one highlighting lookup-augmented drafting as an “obvious in hindsight” optimization for long-context copying/rewrite workloads. Another compared the reported speed favorably to prior local MoE runs, citing roughly `150 tok/s` first-burst code-prompt performance on a Qwen 3.6 MoE setup in llama.cpp.

    - Commenters focused on the claimed **Qwen 3.8 27B + Dflash2** performance, with one user highlighting `134 tps` on an **RTX 3090** as comparable to their prior **Qwen 3.6 MoE** experience in `llama.cpp`, where they saw roughly `150 tok/s` on initial burst code prompts. Another noted the emergence of a **35B A3B MoE** configuration, implying interest in whether the speedup scales across larger sparse models.
    - A technically substantive thread called out **lookup-augmented drafting** as an “obvious in hindsight” speculative-decoding-style optimization, suggesting users see it as a potentially important implementation idea rather than just a benchmark trick. There was also interest in comparing this approach directly against **NInfer** and combining it with **Deepseek Harness** for coding workflows.
    - One commenter requested validation beyond perplexity, asking for **intelligence benchmarks** to verify that the PPL improvements generalize to downstream reasoning/coding quality. They also asked what **dtypes** are used in the custom kernels, specifically to understand whether the algorithms and kernel assumptions can generalize across other GPU architectures.


### 3. Open-Weight Scaling and New Model Releases



  - **[Ornith-1.5 (397B [DeepSWE 56], 35B-A3B, 9B)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vsou3a/ornith15_397b_deepswe_56_35ba3b_9b/)** (Activity: 431): ****Ornith AI** announced [Ornith-1.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/ornith-ai/ornith-15), an open-source model family with **9B dense**, **35B-A3B MoE**, and **397B MoE** variants, trained via self-improving strategies and reporting frontier-like results: Terminal-Bench 2.1 `86.1`, SWE-Bench Verified `86`, SWE-Bench Pro `65.1`, Multilingual `79.6`, DeepSWE `56`, HLE `44.6`, ClawEval `81.4`, and Tool Decathlon `71.2`. A commenter benchmarked **Ornith-1.5 35B-A3B** against **Qwen3.8-27B**, showing Qwen ahead on Terminal-Bench 2.1 (`73.0` vs `68.5`), DeepSWE (`42.2` vs `22.0`), and HLE no-tools (`30.8` vs `25.6`), while Ornith led on NL2Repo (`46.2` vs `42.3`) and tied GPQA Diamond (`89.2`). Another commenter highlighted the **9B** model as especially interesting, linking the project page: [ornith.ai/ornith_1_5.html](https://ornith.ai/ornith_1_5.html).** Comments focused on whether Ornith plans to fine-tune **Qwen3.8-27B**, implicitly questioning whether the 35B-A3B model’s coding/reasoning results are competitive given Qwen’s stronger numbers on several comparable benchmarks.

    - A commenter compared **Ornith-1.5 35B-A3B** against **Qwen3.8-27B** across several benchmarks, showing Qwen ahead on **Terminal-Bench 2.1** (`73.0` vs `68.5`), **DeepSWE** (`42.2` vs `22.0`), and **HLE no-tools** (`30.8` vs `25.6`), while both tied on **GPQA Diamond** at `89.2`. Ornith led on **NL2Repo** (`46.2` vs `42.3`) and reported strong results where no comparable Qwen3.8-27B numbers were cited, including **SWE-bench Verified** `79.0`, **MCP-Atlas** `70.2`, **WideSearch** `67.8`, and **BrowseComp** `67.6`.
    - The **9B Ornith-1.5** variant was called out as particularly interesting, with a link to the official model page: [ornith.ai/ornith_1_5.html](https://ornith.ai/ornith_1_5.html). The comment implies attention to smaller-model capability, but no additional benchmark details were provided in-thread.

  - **[I just built a mini Kimi-K3 from Scratch under 250$. Already beats GPT-2 (124M)!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vth1c3/i_just_built_a_mini_kimik3_from_scratch_under_250/)** (Activity: 933): **The image is a training summary table for a scratch pretraining run of a **mini Kimi-K3-style MoE language model**: `1.02B` total parameters, `145M` active parameters per token, `61M` non-embedding parameters, trained for `38,147` steps on ~`5.0B` tokens using a single **H200** at `$4.54/hr` for a listed total of `$252.35`—slightly contradicting the title’s “under $250” claim. The post says the model replicates Kimi K3 architectural components such as **Kimi Delta Attention**, **Gated MLA**, attention residuals, **LatentMoE** with aux-loss-free balancing, and K3’s `163,840`-token tokenizer; it reports `33.4%` HellaSwag, above **GPT-2 124M**’s cited `28%`, with a full tutorial linked [here](https://books.vizuara.ai/book/pretraining-a-mini-k3) and the image [here](https://i.redd.it/wfbl9726oikh1.png).** Comments were mostly encouraging and exploratory, with users asking about cloud vs local compute and suggesting follow-ups such as scaling to a `35B`/`3B active` MoE or using K3 as a teacher for autonomous RL.

    - A commenter questioned the training-token budget for the reported **1.02B** mini Kimi-K3, arguing it appears heavily undertrained relative to **Chinchilla scaling laws**: roughly `5` tokens per parameter versus the commonly cited `20:1` token/parameter ratio. They suggested reducing model size by about `60%` and increasing dataset size `3–4x` to improve practical performance under the same compute budget.
    - One user compared their own small-LM experiments on a **GTX 1660 Super**, reporting a family of models: `63M A16M`, `92M A22M`, and `220M A25M`, with the `220M` run taking about `98 GPU-hours`. They scaled training data to exceed Chinchilla-style compute-optimal ratios, using about `1B` tokens for the `63M` model and `4.5B` tokens for the `220M`; the `220M` achieved `31.4%` on **HellaSwag** with `n=400`, though they noted the code-heavy dataset made it better at simple Python algorithms than chat.
    - There was interest in follow-up technical work, including whether training used rented cloud compute or local hardware, and a suggestion to try **autonomous RL** using K3 as a teacher model. Another commenter linked their own `63M A16M` model on Hugging Face ([Dsg2/LS-63M-A16M](https://huggingface.co/Dsg2/LS-63M-A16M)) and mentioned ongoing work on `llama.cpp` support for their custom architecture.



  - **[Thoughts About Scaling Law - Z.ai](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1vsf9eg/thoughts_about_scaling_law_zai/)** (Activity: 718): **The image is a **non-meme technical screenshot** of Jie Tang/Z.ai’s X post, [shown here](https://i.redd.it/mpu6o0zi7akh1.png), arguing that modern LLM scaling should not be reduced to parameter count: data, compute allocation, inference cost, MoE activated vs total parameters, and post-training/RL all shift the optimum. The post frames **GLM-5.3** as a controlled experiment over **GLM-5.2** with the same base/architecture/parameter counts but roughly **one month of additional long-horizon environment + RL scaling**, claiming substantial gains from post-training rather than larger pretraining scale.** Commenters generally interpret GLM-5.3 as evidence that Chinese labs such as **Z.ai** are doing frontier-level work rather than merely distilling Western models. One technical thread expands on the same theme, speculating that smaller models could outperform expectations by separating “world knowledge” storage from the computational graph, trading RAM for VRAM in an Engram-like architecture.

    - Discussion framed **GLM 5.3** as a scaling experiment: commenters compared it to **Qwen 3.8 27B**, arguing that strong performance may come from increased reasoning allocation rather than just parameter count. There was speculation that **GLM 5.5** could be closer to **DeepSeek V4 Pro-sized** while remaining relatively small versus other frontier-scale models, potentially improving cost efficiency.
    - One commenter described an experimental **Llama 8B refit** using a DeepSeek-like “Engram” approach, where relatively static “world knowledge” is stored outside the model’s computational graph in a RAM-resident table. The claimed tradeoff is lower VRAM pressure—VRAM mainly holds the ~`8B–9B` model—at the cost of around `32GB` system RAM for the knowledge table, with DDR5 fetches allegedly not PCIe-bound in their tests.
    - The same experimenter argued that externalizing knowledge could make aggressive quantization less damaging: if knowledge-heavy weight regions are preserved in an FP16/FP8 RAM table, pushing the core model to something like `Q4` may have “near zero impact” on retained factual knowledge. They also noted that this architecture may be hard to serve at scale for very large models because operators must balance a large knowledge hash table against VRAM and bandwidth constraints.

### 1. Personalized Cancer Vaccine Phase 3 Results

  - **[Moderna stock, $MRNA , surges over +110% after announcing the first ever positive Phase 3 results for a personalized cancer vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1vso1mh/moderna_stock_mrna_surges_over_110_after/)** (Activity: 1284): ****Moderna (`MRNA`) and Merck** reported the first positive **Phase 3** results for a personalized cancer vaccine, with the melanoma study showing reduced recurrence when used in a large late-stage setting. The program is broadly understood as an individualized neoantigen/mRNA approach paired with immuno-oncology therapy, and the announcement drove `MRNA` stock up more than `+110%`.** Commenters noted that melanoma is unusually well-suited to this modality, but that success there could still support expansion into other tumor types. A technical concern raised was cost: individualized manufacturing could put treatment on the order of `~$150k/person`, limiting global cost-effectiveness without major efficiency gains.

    - Commenters noted that Moderna’s reported Phase 3 success is currently specific to **melanoma**, which may be especially suitable for personalized cancer vaccines due to its immunogenicity and mutation profile. They suggested the platform could potentially generalize to other cancers, but emphasized that melanoma may be a comparatively favorable first target rather than proof of broad pan-cancer efficacy.
    - A key technical/economic concern raised was that individualized mRNA cancer vaccines are inherently expensive because each treatment must be tailored to a patient’s tumor neoantigens. One commenter estimated costs on the order of **`~$150k per patient`**, arguing that without major manufacturing or workflow efficiency gains, global cost-effectiveness would remain limited.
    - Another commenter framed the result as evidence that personalized therapeutic development may be advancing faster than traditional pharmaceutical validation pipelines. They argued that the underlying approach has been known for years, but only now reaching Phase 3 trials, highlighting a tension between rapid individualized medicine production and slower regulatory/testing infrastructure.

  - **[AI is finally curing cancer](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1vtqalk/ai_is_finally_curing_cancer/)** (Activity: 1903): **The [image](https://i.redd.it/c0oma57ogkkh1.jpeg) is primarily a **Star Wars meme** using a tweet about an **AI-assisted personalized mRNA cancer treatment reportedly succeeding in a Phase 3 trial** to joke that demand for GPUs may actually be tied to biomedical progress rather than just hype. The technical context is thin: commenters note that the underlying vaccine work was allegedly developed by `2017`, so the claim that this is a product of the current generative-AI/GPU boom is likely overstated.** Comments push back on the framing, arguing this has “nothing to do with the current AI wave,” while others respond with broader AI-acceleration/singularity jokes rather than technical analysis.

    - Commenters noted that the cancer vaccine/treatment being discussed was reportedly developed around **2017**, arguing that the result should not be attributed to the current generative-AI wave. The substantive point is a timeline/attribution correction: this appears to be based on pre-ChatGPT-era biomedical technology rather than a recent breakthrough enabled by modern LLMs or current AI systems.




### 2. Generalist and Field Robotics Launches

  - **[Introducing GEN-1.5, a one-shot learner](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1vt155o/introducing_gen15_a_oneshot_learner/)** (Activity: 1429): ****Generalist AI** announced **GEN-1.5**, described as a *one-shot learner* for embodied AI/robotics, with examples in the [YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cllCVK-9lo) and [blog post](https://generalistai.com/blog/gen-1.5). The core claim highlighted in the thread is that a user can demonstrate a task once to a robot and have it reproduce/generalize the behavior *“almost immediately”*; the linked Reddit-hosted demo video could not be independently accessed due to Reddit `403 Forbidden` restrictions.** Top commenters framed the result as a major milestone for robotics foundation models, with one calling it *“the equivalent of GPT-2 for embodied AI/robotics.”* Discussion was largely enthusiastic, emphasizing the perceived leap from scripted robot behaviors toward rapid in-situ task learning from a single demonstration.

    - Commenters highlight the linked demo as an example of **one-shot learning for embodied robotics**, where a robot appears to acquire and generalize a new task after a single demonstration: https://reddit.com/link/p4pmjde/video/3ngya01jqekh1/player. One technically minded comparison frames **GEN-1.5** as *“the equivalent of GPT-2 for embodied AI/robotics”*, implying an early but potentially pivotal scaling milestone for general-purpose robot control.
    - A more speculative technical thread notes that the one-shot adaptation may be an **emergent property** from scaling with a particular “data shape,” rather than an explicitly engineered capability. The commenter asks whether similar dynamics could transfer to purely digital models, especially around rapid task improvisation via *minor weight adjustment* or analogous fast adaptation mechanisms.

  - **[DaxAI's all terrain robot-horse debuts at WRC'26: 100Km/10h autonomy, 300Kg max load, 40Km/h max speed](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1vthwpm/daxais_all_terrain_robothorse_debuts_at_wrc26/)** (Activity: 1423): ****DaxAI** reportedly debuted an all-terrain quadruped “robot-horse” at **WRC ’26**, with claimed specs of `100 km` range / `10 h` autonomy, `300 kg` maximum payload, and `40 km/h` top speed. The linked Reddit video ([v.redd.it/niyx5b3cvikh1](https://v.redd.it/niyx5b3cvikh1)) was not accessible due to a **403 Forbidden** response, so the claims could not be independently verified from the media.** Top comments were mostly non-technical: users joked about a “horseless horse” and expressed interest despite expecting poor ride comfort.



### 3. Claude Code Real-World Workflow Signals

  - **[Finally. Could this be the smoking gun that makes Opus less load-bearing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1vt6gf8/finally_could_this_be_the_smoking_gun_that_makes/)** (Activity: 2114): **The image shows an [X.com announcement screenshot](https://i.redd.it/2gt7o7xqufkh1.jpeg) that **Claude Code** now supports a `Concise` output style configurable via `/config`, intended to make the agent *lead with results*, reduce verbosity, and still expand when asked. In the context of the title, commenters frame this as potentially making cheaper/faster Claude configurations more usable by reducing the verbose “Opus-like” scaffolding that can make Claude Code feel load-bearing for complex debugging workflows.** Comments are mostly critical of Claude’s current writing style, joking that the new mode may simply suppress phrases like “smoking gun,” “load-bearing,” and “dispatching a subagent.” One commenter speculates the change may be implemented through an added system-prompt instruction such as “Stop vomiting techno-garble.”

    - Commenters infer that **Claude’s verbosity/style shift** may be driven by changes to the system prompt or style-control layer, with one user jokingly paraphrasing the likely instruction as *“Stop vomiting techno-garble.”* A more technical point is raised about **custom output styles**: one commenter argues they are not reliable enough to explain or fix the behavior, saying that anyone who has tested them knows they *“do not work,”* implying persistent issues with controllability of Claude’s response style.



  - **[exactly the kind of problem AI was made for](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1vtcblx/exactly_the_kind_of_problem_ai_was_made_for/)** (Activity: 4182): **The image is a tweet showing **Claude being used to write a macOS driver/shim for an obscure HP printer with only Windows support** ([image](https://i.redd.it/z8kjfhmvchkh1.jpeg)). Technically, the interesting claim is not generic “AI writes code,” but that an LLM may help with a niche compatibility task involving **driver behavior, API translation, hardware I/O assumptions, and possibly reverse engineering Windows-only printer support**.** Commenters were cautiously impressed but skeptical, with one saying they would be “really really impressed if this works.” A technical commenter noted that a full driver rewrite may not be necessary: the Windows driver could potentially be shimmed by intercepting its API calls and mapping them to macOS equivalents, except for any direct hardware access.

    - Commenters focused on using AI for **reverse engineering proprietary drivers**, noting that current models are already strong at decompilation-style reasoning but are often restricted from assisting with reverse-engineering workflows.
    - A technical suggestion argued that full driver reimplementation may be unnecessary: instead, one could **hook the Windows driver’s API calls** and shim them to macOS equivalents, while separately handling any direct hardware-access instructions. The idea is to let the original driver logic continue executing as if it were still in a Windows environment.

  - **[Why does Claude Code say things like, “that’s about 3 days of work” then proceeds to do it all in a 20 minutes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1vscjcz/why_does_claude_code_say_things_like_thats_about/)** (Activity: 1395): **A user reports **Claude Code** frequently produces human-scale project estimates (e.g. “days” or “weeks”) during planning, then completes the implementation in `20–30 minutes`. The likely technical explanation raised in comments is that its time estimates are inherited from **training data containing human software-engineering estimates**, not calibrated to the agent’s actual execution speed, tool-use loop, or repository-specific task history.** Commenters generally framed this as a calibration issue rather than a capability issue: Claude appears to estimate like a human developer unless explicitly instructed otherwise. One user reported improving estimates by adding a custom skill that makes Claude inspect `git` commit history and base predictions on observed repo/task timelines, including expected debugging risk.

    - One technical explanation suggested Claude Code’s time estimates are likely biased by **training data based on human software-engineering timelines**, so it predicts calendar effort as if a human developer will perform the work rather than the model executing many steps directly. This could explain why it estimates *“12 weeks”* or *“3 days”* but completes the implementation much faster when delegated end-to-end.
    - A commenter described improving estimation accuracy by creating a custom skill that instructs the model to inspect **git commit history** and base forecasts on observed project velocity. They reported this gave Claude a better sense of its own timelines, including cases where it anticipates uncertainty from likely failures or debugging loops.

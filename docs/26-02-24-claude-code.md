# AI Twitter Recap

**Frontier model ecosystem: Qwen 3.5 “medium series” and open-weight momentum**

- **Qwen 3.5 Medium Model Series**: Alibaba released a tightly scoped set of “more intelligence, less compute” models—**Qwen3.5-Flash** (hosted), **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (MoE)**, **Qwen3.5-122B-A10B (MoE)**, and **Qwen3.5-27B (dense)**—arguing that architecture + data + RL can outperform sheer parameter scaling. Notable details include **Flash defaulting to 1M context** and built-in tools in the hosted offering. See the full announcement and links to Hugging Face/ModelScope/APIs from [@Alibaba_Qwen](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026339351530188939).  
  - Early practitioner reactions emphasize how strong **35B-A3B** and **122B-A10B** feel in practice (e.g., [@andrew_n_carr](https://x.com/andrew_n_carr/status/2026347588950372752), [@JustinLin610](https://x.com/JustinLin610/status/2026343725719568395)), plus the “intelligence-per-watt” implication of a **35B model surpassing a 235B predecessor** noted by [@awnihannun](https://x.com/awnihannun/status/2026353100144218569).  
  - **Deployment/serving stack is moving fast**: community tooling quickly followed—GGUF + sizing guidance from [@UnslothAI](https://x.com/UnslothAI/status/2026351337970217357) and local-run enthusiasm like “35B-A3B is all you need” from [@terryyuezhuo](https://x.com/terryyuezhuo/status/2026344442186326332). Qwen also highlighted SGLang support ([tweet](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2026348924433477775)).  
  - **Quant + “local frontier” trendline**: INT4 variants appeared (duplicate posts) via [@HaihaoShen](https://x.com/HaihaoShen/status/2026208062009426209), and users continue pushing aggressive quantization workflows (e.g., Unsloth praise for ultra-low-bit local Qwen by [@0xSero](https://x.com/0xSero/status/2026223879077712269)).  
  - **Evaluation signals**: Qwen’s flagship **Qwen3.5-397B-A17B** trended on HF ([@Ali_TongyiLab](https://x.com/Ali_TongyiLab/status/2026211680653611174)) and showed up strongly on agentic webdev-style evaluation in Code Arena ([Arena post](https://x.com/arena/status/2026337606137725363)). Arena also posted rank deltas vs Qwen 3.0 ([comparison](https://x.com/arena/status/2026404630297719100)).  

**OpenAI + Anthropic “coding agents as product surface area” (APIs, remote control, web sockets, proof-of-work UX)**

- **OpenAI: GPT-5.3-Codex in the Responses API**: OpenAI shipped **GPT-5.3-Codex** to all developers via the **Responses API** ([announcement](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2026379092661289260)), with pricing cited by [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2026379113099862018) (**$1.75 input / $14 output** as tweeted). OpenAI also expanded **file input types** (docx/pptx/csv/xlsx/etc.) for agents ingesting “real-world files” directly ([tweet](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2026420817568084436)).  
  - Infra detail: web sockets show up as a meaningful lever for agent throughput—**“30% faster rollouts”** per [@gdb](https://x.com/gdb/status/2026380170765152302). This matches broader chatter about why websockets took time and how state is stored upstream vs VRAM ([thread](https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/2026219239477215657), [follow-up](https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/2026223111021220265)).  
  - Benchmarks: third-party scoreboard posts claim strong placements for Codex 5.3 across TerminalBench/IOI/LiveCodeBench/VibeCodeBench ([ValsAI](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2026385804940230786)).  

- **Anthropic: “Claude Code Remote Control” + enterprise workflow push**: Anthropic introduced “Remote Control” for Claude Code—start a terminal session locally and **continue from your phone**—first via [@noahzweben](https://x.com/noahzweben/status/2026371260805271615), then officialized by [@claudeai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2026418433911603668), with rollout confirmation from [@_catwu](https://x.com/_catwu/status/2026421789476401182).  
  - Separate enterprise positioning: “Cowork and plugin updates” for customizing Claude across teams landed with extremely high engagement ([@claudeai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2026305186671608315)).  



- **Cursor: “review is demo videos, not diffs”**: Cursor announced a major UX pivot—agents can **use the software they build**, then send **videos of their work** (“demos, not diffs”) ([launch](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2026369873321013568), [links](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2026369880795263328)). Multiple builders describe cloud agents as a practical step-change: async, VM-based testing, self-verification, and demo artifacts ([example](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/2026379400879730794), [another](https://x.com/jsngr/status/2026371033201103036), [“creative director over sims”](https://x.com/jasonyuan/status/2026375381872423133)).  

**Diffusion for language: Inception Labs Mercury 2 and “speed as the next battleground”**

- **Mercury 2 (“reasoning diffusion LLM”)**: Inception Labs released **Mercury 2**, positioning it as a production diffusion LLM hitting **~1,000 output tokens/s** ([Stefano Ermon](https://x.com/StefanoErmon/status/2026340720064520670)). Artificial Analysis contextualizes it as *not* frontier-leading on intelligence, but unusually strong on **output speed** with decent agentic/coding evaluations, including comparisons on Terminal-Bench Hard and IFBench scoring claims ([analysis thread](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2026360491799621744)).  
- The deeper takeaway across these posts: teams are betting that **architecture-level parallel token refinement** (diffusion) can make multi-step agent loops and voice assistants feel “native” rather than “batchy” (see the architectural explanation from [@LiorOnAI](https://x.com/LiorOnAI/status/2026376138428395908)). This sits alongside broader sentiment that 2026 competition may be defined by **latency + throughput**, not just raw benchmark maxima.

**Agents: reliability, safety failures, memory + context rot, and new multilingual evals**

- **Agent reliability is not keeping pace with capability**: A Princeton-led effort formalizes and measures the **capability–reliability gap**, decomposing reliability into **12 dimensions** and finding only modest reliability gains despite large capability gains ([paper + dashboard](https://x.com/steverab/status/2026383575080108436); additional commentary from [@random_walker](https://x.com/random_walker/status/2026384543700115870)). This aligns with recurring “long tail of failures” intuition from practitioners comparing agents to AVs ([ahall_research](https://x.com/ahall_research/status/2026338695536848987)).  
- **OpenClaw and “routine-step decomposition” safety bypass**: A concrete agent failure mode: “split a dangerous command into a few routine steps → safety is gone,” with inbox-wiping behavior cited; authors claim an open-source fix ([paper thread](https://x.com/shi_weiyan/status/2026300129901445196)).  
- **AGENTS.md (and equivalents) can hurt**: Two high-signal posts summarize research showing **LLM-generated context files decrease success** while increasing costs; developer-written minimal context helps slightly but still increases cost. See [@omarsar0](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2026306141181898887) for the paper summary and [@_philschmid](https://x.com/_philschmid/status/2026354033418547444) for a practical “how to write it” guide grounded in the same result set.  
- **New SWE-bench Multilingual leaderboard**: A push to evaluate software engineering agents beyond English/Python. The leaderboard covers **300 tasks in 9 languages**, none from SWE-bench Verified, with reported SOTA at **72%** ([launch](https://x.com/OfirPress/status/2026324248973689068); more stats from [@KLieret](https://x.com/KLieret/status/2026322986907652295)). The implication: model rankings can invert across languages—important for global dev tooling and for data-collection strategies.  

**Data + benchmarks: OCR saturation, “new optimizer” skepticism, and adaptive/continual data pitches**



- **OCR/文档解析基准测试趋于饱和**：多篇帖子指出 OmniDocBench 正面临瓶颈（例如，在真实文档上失败率为 **~95%**），且精确匹配指标（exact-match metrics）会惩罚语义正确的解析。参见 [@llama_index](https://x.com/llama_index/status/2026342120236396844) 和 [@jerryjliu0](https://x.com/jerryjliu0/status/2026408921385284001)。相关讨论还包括：尽管合成数据廉价但 OCR 为何依然困难（[gabriberton](https://x.com/gabriberton/status/2026335831632626156)），以及一项研究表明文本提取在 PDF QA 中优于图像表示（[cwolferesearch](https://x.com/cwolferesearch/status/2026344301907583469)）。
- **“Nature MI 优化器”争议**：一篇高度技术性的批评指出，某篇拥有引人注目图表的全新优化器论文存在基准线（baselines）可疑以及潜在的测试集超参数选择问题，呼吁进行独立验证并使用调优更好的基准线（例如 nanogpt speedrun）进行对比（[giffmana](https://x.com/giffmana/status/2026223201957597563)；以及来自 [@YouJiacheng](https://x.com/YouJiacheng/status/2026224486367027622) 的额外实验背景）。
- **Adaption Labs：“自适应数据（Adaptive Data）”**：多条推文推介了从静态数据集向“活资产”循环（living asset loop）的转变，声称在 **242 种语言**中平均实现了 **82% 的质量提升**，并推出了早期访问/社区计划（[company](https://x.com/adaptionlabs/status/2026281291847446721)；来自 [@sarahookr](https://x.com/sarahookr/status/2026286134104613157) 的额外解读；第三方转述见[此处](https://x.com/sudip_r0y/status/2026286762851774475)）。在更多方法论公开之前，应将其视为一种趋势性论题（数据漂移/反馈循环），而非经过验证的标准。

**计算、芯片与机器人：Meta–AMD 巨额交易、MatX 的 “HBM+SRAM” 押注以及人形机器人控制的扩展**

- **Meta ↔ AMD 基础设施交易**：Meta 宣布达成一项多年期协议，整合 AMD Instinct GPU，并为该部署规划了 **~6GW** 的数据中心容量（[@AIatMeta](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/2026266818789454057)）。评论认为这是 NVIDIA 财报前夕的一个重大资本支出/计算信号（[kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2026279386681356704)）。

*   **Qwen 3.5 Sweeps Open-Weight Leaderboards**: Alibaba dropped a massive update with [Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base weights](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base), impressing developers by outperforming the older **235B** model despite its significantly smaller footprint. The massive **Qwen3.5-397B-A17B** variant also crashed the Code Arena leaderboard, snagging the **#17 overall** spot and matching proprietary heavyweights like **GPT-5.2** and **Gemini-3-Flash**.
*   **OpenAI Quietly Deploys GPT-5.3-Codex to the Masses**: OpenAI officially launched [GPT-5.3-Codex on OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-5.3-codex) across all developer APIs, pricing it aggressively at **$1.75** for input and **$14** for output tokens. OpenRouter immediately integrated the model alongside a new `openrouter/free` endpoint that automatically routes developer requests to zero-cost fallback models.
*   **GPT-OSS 20B Achieves Sci-Fi Speeds on Consumer GPUs**: Engineers clocked the new **GPT-OSS 20B** model at a staggering **260 t/s** on a standard **RTX 5090** thanks to its **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture relying on only **3B active parameters**. The model easily fits entirely within high-speed **VRAM** and natively supports **flash attention**, marking a massive win for local inference enthusiasts running consumer hardware.

**Theme 3. System-Level Engineering, Hardware Scaling & Kernel Optimizations**

*   **MatX Bags $500M to Build the Ultimate LLM Chip**: MatX secured a **$500M Series B** to develop the **MatX One LLM chip**, featuring a splittable systolic array that combines SRAM-level low latency with **HBM long-context support** via this [MatX funding announcement](https://x.com/reinerpope/status/2026351870852358492). Concurrently, Meta inked a deal to deploy **6GW of AMD-based infrastructure** over five years, leveraging the new **RRCLLX** protocol to heavily optimize **AMD MI300X** multi-GPU communications.
*   **Pre-built FlashAttention 3 Wheels Hit Production**: AI engineers can finally ditch tedious custom compilations because [pre-built Flash Attention 3 wheels](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/flash-attn-3/) are now officially live for **CUDA 12.6+** and **13**. These **LibTorch ABI stable** drops support both **x86/ARM CPUs** and **Linux/Windows OS**, completely slashing setup times for developers running **Python 3.10+** and **PyTorch 2.9+**.
*   **Llama.cpp Update Wrecks Qwen and VRAM Allocation**: The latest **llama.cpp** build out of the master branch threw fatal *Failed to read magic* errors, completely failing to parse the **GGUF headers** for **Qwen3.5** models. Engineers isolated the bug to a recent overflow fix that inadvertently blocks proper **VRAM** allocation, forcing developers to frantically rollback to release **8145** to restore functionality.

**Theme 4. Tooling, Agentic Workflows, and Developer Infrastructure**



*   **Cursor Cloud Agents 免费发布**：**Cursor** 正式推出了全新的 **Cloud Agents** 功能，为开发者提供完全免费的云环境，可以直接从编辑器中运行测试、执行终端命令并部署实时演示（[Cursor onboarding 链接](https://cursor.com/onboard)）。然而，社区立即遇到了执行限制，并开始积极游说开发者提供一种安全的方式，允许 Agent 绕过提升的 **sudo** 密码限制。
*   **Aider 开发者遭遇 Diff 格式化瓶颈**：流行的 **Aider** CLI 工具在处理复杂的多文件代码库编辑时出现卡顿，受到 Diff 格式损坏的困扰，迫使开发者不得不手动分块处理更改。工程师们通过提交 [Aider GitHub issue #3603](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/3603) 反馈了该工具的局限性，恳求支持原生 **git submodule**，而该框架目前完全忽略了这一功能。
*   **Tiny-GPU 编译器实现 C 到 Verilog 的转换**：硬件黑客发布了 [tiny-gpu-compiler 项目](https://github.com/gautam1858/tiny-gpu-compiler)，这是一个教育性质的**基于 MLIR 的编译器**，可将类 C 语言的内核代码直接翻译成 **16位二进制指令**。该流水线针对完全由 Verilog 编写的自定义开源 GPU 硬件，并附带一个用于精确执行分析的分步可视化器。

**主题 5. 基准测试动荡与评估器大洗牌**

*   **OpenAI 因数据污染弃用 SWE-Bench Verified**：在发现前沿模型经常纯粹基于记忆的测试 ID 复现精确的任务解决方案后，OpenAI 正式弃用了流行的 **SWE-Bench Verified** 基准测试。根据其 [SWE-bench 弃用公告](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2026025368650690932)，工程师们证明剩余未解决的问题中约有 **60%** 在结构上存在缺陷，使得继续进行基准测试完全是浪费计算资源。
*   **EleutherAI 紧急修复 HuggingFace 上的 Pythia 重复项**：研究人员发现了一个严重漏洞，[EleutherAI 的 pythia-2.8b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.23024) 在 Hugging Face Hub 上无论选择哪个修订步骤都提供相同的模型权重。在确认之前的上传内容被错误地去重后，团队立即启动了重新训练，并部署了新修正的 [Pythia-14m](https://huggingface.co/stellaathena/pythia-14m) 和 [Pythia-31m](https://huggingface.co/stellaathena/pythia-31m) 模型。
*   **LMArena 过滤器禁用掷骰子指令**：**LMArena** 的审核过滤器完全失控，自动拒绝了极其温和的提示词（如简单的掷骰子），仅仅是因为其中包含了被标记的触发词如 *liar*。开发者承认了过于激进的拦截行为，并正在拼命测试**基于 LLM 的过滤**和放宽 [OpenAI moderation API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/moderation/) 阈值，以恢复评估队列的正常秩序。

- ****优化**：压榨 GPU 的更多性能**：要优化 GPU 代码，应该衡量操作需要读取多少内存以及 GPU 读取该内存的速度，同时还要衡量该操作需要执行多少次计算以及 GPU 执行这些计算的速度。
   - 对于 **RMS norm**，性能很可能受内存限制（memory bound），因此应专注于优化内存访问模式和带宽利用率，并参考 [Nvidia 关于异步拷贝的 CUDA 文档](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/async-copies.html#batching-loads-in-conditional-code)。
- ****同步**：深入探讨 CUDA 的异步内存拷贝**：在使用 `CUDA C++ cuda::memcpy_async` 时，必须使用 `__syncthreads()` 以保证内存可见性（memory visibility），确保所有线程都能看到由任何线程复制的数据，这一点已在 [关于异步屏障的 CUDA 文档](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/async-barriers.html#tracking-asynchronous-memory-operations) 中得到明确说明。
- ****移植规范**：验证 CUDA 代码**：在将 CPU 代码移植到 CUDA 以用于生产环境时，验证的一般指导原则包括管理浮点精度，并为不同浮点大小的 **GEMM** 等操作设置标准容差（tolerances），尤其是在进行 GPU 版本更迭期间。
   - 该方法取决于具体上下文（如 **PyTorch** 或 **VLLM**），涉及考虑要验证的适当代码单元（Kernels）、要测试的输入/输出数量，以及简单精度之外的更广泛问题。

   - The performance gap is investigated, questioning if an *ideal* warp-based *getmem* variant could close the gap with *nvshmem_ptr*.
- ****NVSHMEM** Pointer Performance Edge Highlighted**: A key finding from testing **NVSHMEM** is that direct pointer access (*nvshmem_ptr*) outperforms explicit memory transfers (*nvshmem_get*), due to the pointer version not using a temporary buffer.
   - One of the experts suggests that the pointer version eliminates buffering, leading to a performance boost and more elegant code, however, *the put version should be better than the get one, but I haven't had time to write it.*

> `String templating in Mojo, Writable and Writer traits, ExternalFunction struct` 


- **Mojo's String Template Engine Proposal Surfaces**: A member has opened a proposal for a new **string templating feature** in Mojo, with the [discussion thread on the forum](https://forum.modular.com/t/writable-writer-template-engines/2763).
   - The feature is likely to be **post-1.0**, with hopes of extending the current `Writable`/`Writer` trait into a more complex `TemplatedWritable`.
- **`Writable` & `Writer` traits need love**: The current `Writable` and `Writer` traits should be minimal with extension/customization points via other traits or via defaulted trait methods/types.
   - The roadmap will prioritize other features like **Int unification** before addressing the proposal, with the goal of unifying `write_to` and `write_repr_to` implementations into a single function.
- **ExternalFunction struct trick**: A member mentioned they have been using the `ExternalFunction` struct as inspiration and looking for a fancier version to decompose the function sig into its params / return types.
   - They will likely need to code the **origin casts for all external pointers**.
